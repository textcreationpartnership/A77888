            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no duty more neglected amongſt Chriſtians, than this of Meditation: whence it is, that though the heads of many are ſwelled with notions, yet their hearts are very empty of grace and good affections. A Treatiſe therefore of Meditation, which would remove obſtructions, and open the paſſages between the brain and heart, could never bee more ſeaſonable or neceſſary than in theſe daies, wherein there is <hi>Multum ſcientiae, &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum conſcientiae:</hi> men being much taken up with ſpeculative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſal matters, to finde them diſcourſe; but little meditating upon plain and practical truths,
<pb facs="tcp:170506:4"/>to affect their hearts, and amend their lives. It is a ſad and a ſtrange thing, that there ſhould bee more light in the world, an increaſe of knowledge, and leſs heat, a decay of love; that there ſhould bee ſo much profitable preaching, and yet no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting amongſt the hearers: one cauſe whereof doubtleſs is, the omiſſion of this duty. We muſt read and conſider, hear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if wee would get good by what wee read and hear: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meditation Truths are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, not digeſted. And as leanneſs of ſoul is to bee ſeen in many through ſinful rejection, and caſting away of wholeſome food; ſo the like is to bee ſeen in others, that are fed with ſuch food, for want of good concoctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
            </p>
            <p>This little Tractate of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently learned, judicious, and
<pb facs="tcp:170506:4"/>godly Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> is to teach the Art of Divine Meditation, to help thy ſpiritual digeſtion, wouldeſt thou take in the advice herein contained, thou ſhouldeſt finde thy ſoul growing and thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by it.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is a thouſand pitties that any thing of this Reverend Author (humane frailty excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſhould die with him; though this ſmall peece hath ſeemed to lie buried in oblivion hitherto, 'tis now riſen, as from the dead, to admoniſh us of a neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; will again riſe in judgement againſt them, that ſhall ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their ſinful and ſhameful omiſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Though it be <hi>poſthumous,</hi> yet thou mayeſt be confident it is not ſpurious:
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Heary Baker.</hi>
               </note> were the perſon in whoſe hands this Copy lay, as well known to others as to us,
<pb facs="tcp:170506:5"/>they would deſire no more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying evidence than his affirming (as he did) that hee received it from the Reverend Authors own hand.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt here the ſubſtance of the original Copy, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further alteration, than what the overſight of the Tranſcriber, here and there made neceſſary. And though there may be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſomewhat of that accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this peece, which was in others prepared for the Preſs by the Authors own hand, yet they who are acquainted with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works, will clearly ſee a great reſemblance between this and them.</p>
            <p>As to the doctrine herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, 'tis uſeful and excellent, and that which few have ſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically handled: but they who look for quaintneſs of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:170506:5"/>more than the quickning of their affections, and right order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their converſations, muſt turn away their eyes; this was not written for them; The excellency of Rules lieth in their fitneſs to direct in neceſſary duties, and thoſe which this book affords, have more of ſolidity than luſtre, of uſe than ſhew.</p>
            <p>Let us intreat thee therefore not only to read over this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, but to live it over, leſt thou ſhouldeſt miſtake the end of its publication. And do not think this holy exerciſe is ſuch a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous task, as that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of it; 'tis ſuch a duty, as after a little experience thou wilt finde to be not ſo much a burden, as a ſpiritual recreation; and that to preſs thee to the practice of it, is in effect, but to perſwade thee to delight thy
<pb facs="tcp:170506:6"/>ſelf with ſitting to the fire, when thou art benummed with cold, or to pleaſe and refreſh thy ſelf with food, when thou art ready to periſh with hunger, nay, ſuch ſenſitive refreſhments are not to be compared with theſe ſpiritual delights of getting a dead cold heart warmed, a ſtarved ſoul nouriſhed by digeſting its food by Divine Meditation. The greateſt difficulty will be in thy firſt ſetting to this duty, which when once thou art acquainted with, thou wilt be angry with thy ſelf, that thou either knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or began it no ſooner.</p>
            <p>Courteous Reader, we cannot take our leave of thee, till wee have once more intreated thee to ſet to this duty. If thou wouldeſt be bleſſed in all thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes or concernments with the bleſſings of God, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8.
<pb facs="tcp:170506:6"/>If thou wouldeſt have thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding inlightened with the knowledge of God, thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inflamed with the love of God, thy heart eſtabliſhed with the promiſes of God, thy ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs cheared up with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of God, thy afflictions mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated with the comforts of God; and if thou wouldeſt have thy thoughts, words and works regulated by the command of God, pray and conſider, pray and meditate.</p>

            <p>Or it is a ſtedfaſt and earneſt bending of the mind upon ſome ſpiritual and heavenly matter, diſcourſing thereof with our ſelves, till wee bring the ſame to ſome profitable iſſue, both for

               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, It is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, who hath ſupream Authority to command what hee pleaſeth; is infinite in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170506:11"/>to judge what is moſt profitable for us, and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to himſelf; is of great Power to puniſh our contempt, and abundant in Goodneſs to reward our obedience. It is his good pleaſure that wee ſhould purpoſely ſeparate our ſelves from other matters, to think ſeriouſly upon ſome good and holy obſervation, that our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings might bee better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our affections ſtirred to hate evil, and love good.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> How neceſſary this heavenly exerciſe is, may eaſily be conceived, for that the hearts even of good Chriſtians are too much peſtered with unſavoury thoughts, deſires and delights of folly, vanity, and much other naughtineſs, that they think it utterly impoſſible to bring them to any better point; and no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170506:12"/>wonder if they neglect this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Meditation, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the beſt ſetled Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is dim, his memory feeble, his affections ſo overlaid with ſin, that without much ſtriving hee cannot mount aloft, nor run ſwiftly in the way of Gods Commandments. So ponderous is the fleſh that preſſeth down, that unleſs wee labour the thing with our hearts, the word will not ſtick faſt, nor work kindly, nor our affections riſe to any good purpoſes: would wee thrive in grace, and raiſe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and delight in heavenly things? wee muſt breathe our ſelves well in Meditation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Would you have examples for the warrant of this neceſſary practice? Naturally wee deſire not to go alone nor travel in a way which none hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170506:12"/>trodden before us; wee may truly affirm, all godly men have meditated, and the moſt holy have moſt abounded in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: This the Holy Ghoſt reporteth of <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Patriarch,
<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 24.63.</note> 
               <hi>That hee went out into the field towards the evening to meditate,</hi> which had not been ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, if hee had not uſed ſo to do (being ſuch holy duties ſhould bee often uſed) herein following his Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was the friend of God, and very familiar with him.
<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 5.22.</note> 
               <hi>Enoch</hi> in his whole life <hi>walked with God,</hi> and had much talk and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him. <hi>David</hi> promiſed <hi>to</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Pſa. 119.48. Pſal. 119.148.</note> 
               <hi>meditate on the ſtatutes of the Lord.</hi> And what hee vowed, that hee did perform, <hi>Mine eyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the morning watch, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on thy word.</hi> His life was a life of ſorrow; before hee came to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170506:13"/>the Kingdome, <hi>Saul</hi> hunted him like a Partridge; after hee was incumbred with wars abroad, and the diſobedience and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of his ſons at home, what time could hee take to commune with God? how could hee quiet his heart, or bring it into order? when others ſlept, his eyes were waking, and his heart was mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon God, his word and works; his reins did teach him in the night ſeaſon. What point of divinity can bee learned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meditation? not one; for, as none can ſay that it is his own work, which his own hands hath not made: So, none can count any point of divinity his own, which he hath not wrought by the Meditation of his own heart.</p>
            <p>Amongſt Chriſtians, who have excelled? ſuch as have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170506:13"/>been moſt frequent and earneſt in this exerciſe of holy Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, preſſing their hearts to the love of God, and ſolacing themſelves in the remembrance of his love: Even as much odds as is betwixt a young ſcholar that can onely ſay his part, and patter over his rules by rote, and a learned School-maſter that by long practice and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath the uſe thereof; or as there is between a cunning Artificer that can make his own work, and an ignorant Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper that only ſells the ſame; ſuch or more is the difference between the Chriſtian that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.97, 98, 99.</note> and him that meditateth not; <hi>David</hi> attained to more wiſdome, than the Antient, his teachers, his enemies, it was by meditation of the Law of God.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:170506:14"/>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Lord by his Prophet complaineth of the neglect of this duty,

            </p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Meditation putteth life and ſtrength into all other duties, and parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard of the affliction of his brethren, and the ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a deep and earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods judgements, and of the cauſes thereof, which were the ſins of the people; that thereby hee might bee the more fit to humble himſelf by prayer and faſting before the Lord
<note n="a" place="margin">Neh. 1.2,—7.</note>. When <hi>Peter</hi> came to himſelf, and knew where hee was, and from what hee was delivered, and by whom; then hee began with all thankfulneſs, to muſe on the great danger hee had eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of the author and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument

            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Meditation diſcovers corruption, and acquaints us with the rebellion of our hearts and lives, with our blindneſs, ſecurity, earthly-mindedneſs, and infinite other loathſome fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſes, which neither wee our ſelves would take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, while wee carry our ſelves in many things as good Chriſtians amongſt men; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any other would ever think that ſo much poiſon could bee incloſed in ſo narrow a room, as within the compaſs of one ſilly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170506:20"/>man or woman; The vanity of mind, &amp; frowardneſs of will, will ſhew themſelves ſooner in this duty, than in any other. By the hearing of the Law comes the knowledge of ſin, but never ſo clear and diſtinct, as when wee conſtantly ſet our ſelves to walk with God; Let us obſerve what unfaithfulneſs, injuſtice, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, impatience, breaketh forth in our callings; what wearineſs, coldneſs, deadneſs, diſtruſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the heart in prayer; how full of wandrings, forgetful, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent, how ſoon tyred wee bee in hearing the Word, how ſenſeleſs, froward, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted under the Rod, and wee ſhall bee forced to acknowledge that wee are very ſtubborn, and rebellious, prone to evil, and averſe to that which is good.</p>
            <p>But ſet thy ſelf to think upon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170506:21"/>ſome inſtruction that hath been taught, or thou haſt obſerved, do it ſeriouſly, conſcionably, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly, conſtantly, as one who deſireth to ſpend all time well, and then corruption of nature will ſhew it ſelf; Thou ſhalt ſoon perceive that thou art vain, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, impotent, proud, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſelf-conceited, fickle, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, impatient, unprofitable, an harbourer of filthy luſts, a ſtiff oppoſer of ſound holineſs, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, unſound, and what not? Begin to meditate when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offered, thou art bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and canſt finde nothing fit to bee matter of muſing, canſt make uſe of nothing which thou haſt heard or ſeen; haſt thou found matter? thou art dull, and ſenſleſs, not able to faſten one thought upon it, as is meer, ſo hard-hearted, that nothing can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170506:21"/>pierce or enter; Thou ſetteſt forward, but art quickly turned out of the way, that thou mayeſt well wonder to ſee how far thou art ſtrayed before that thou couldeſt diſcern that thou haſt ſtepped aſide; ſome idle toy, earthly buſineſs, vain pleaſure, needleſs fear, delightful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſin hath drawn thy thoughts another way. Do not theſe things diſplay the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our evil and corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>Moreover, by Meditation wee look into every dark, filthy corner of our naughty hearts, and rake into that ſtinking cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, which is ſeldome ſtirred: So that when wee ſet about it, wee ſhall bee compelled to ſay, I heard of corruption by the hearing of the ear, but now I ſee it with mine eye; I feel it to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170506:22"/>the great diſturbance of my ſoul. And thus wee are drawn to deny our ſelves, humble our ſouls, and ſeek to Chriſt for ſuccour and relief.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is a ſpiritual means to purge out ſin, and to cleanſe the ground of our heart from thoſe noiſome, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful weeds that grow in them. No means more available to rince and purifie them, to break the bed of ſins, and hunt away the litter of prophane luſts, none comparable to this.
<note place="margin">Note.</note> For though by the Word wee know them, by conference wee revive the remembrance of them, and by reading wee do both,
<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> yet all theſe run out of our riven heads, and abide meanly with us to ſuppreſs our corruption, and to tame our hearts, until wee bring our ſelves to often
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170506:22"/>and much muſing, and debating of the good things, which wee hear and read, that ſo wee may digeſt them; and of the evils, which by occaſion wee fall into, that wee abandon them: Even as worldly men ponder deeply their affairs, which are weighty. Meditation makes known the hainouſnefs of ſin, inflames the heart with love of holineſs, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth the graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (which are as fire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the droſs of ſin) and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to earneſtneſs in prayer, to bee ſet at liberty from that cruel bondage.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the conſcionable performance of this duty of Application of the Word, with Examination, and Prayer, which is done by Meditation, is, through the bleſſing of God very effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, to kill, and crucifie the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170506:23"/>luſts of the fleſh: The ſpecial ſins prevented by this exerciſe. Are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Idle roavings, unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table wandrings, unſavoury thoughts, wiſhes and deſires of heart; who groans not under this burden? who is not much hindered by them? They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract in prayer, reading, hearing, and cool our zeal, dead our hearts, waſte much precious time, ſteal away comfort, defile the ſoul, and bring forth <hi>much</hi> dangerous fruit.</p>
            <p>The ſpecial medicine to cure this malady is Meditation, it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keeps, or thruſts out frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and idle thoughts and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either it prevents them, or keeps them under.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170506:23"/>it is an eaſie matter for the theef to enter; but if the heart be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in goodneſs, evil cannot finde room, and harbour; The foul ſpirit being caſt out of a man, ſeeketh to return with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſpirits worſe than himſelf,

Hath vanity taken root? To remove it, no means more profitable than oft
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170506:24"/>and deep conſideration of the ſwarms of evil cogitations that ariſe in the mind, to bring them into vile account, to bee weary and aſhamed of them, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to entertain and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour better motions and deſires in their room. What Chriſtian can endure to have his heart ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up as a lodge, or ſty, for froth, filth; vanity, idleneſs, or folly, that ſeeth the loathſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and knows how, and where to furniſh himſelf with heavenly and comfortable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Hee will judge himſelf, watch, and make earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, never ceaſing till the number of idle imaginations bee abated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Earthly-mindedneſſe, and the inordinate love of things temporal, are bad weeds that cover much ground, bitter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170506:24"/>roots that ſtick faſt in our nature, ſins that ſet open the heart for Satan to take poſſeſſion, and dwell therein, that make the Word unprofitable, becauſe it cannot have right and ſound plantation, that are attended with multitude of other ſins, and never go alone.</p>
            <p>The only means to dig them out of the heart, is Meditation: Look into the vanity, deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, uncertainty, vexation that outward things bring with them, and thou wilt never ſet thy heart upon them.
<note place="margin">Pſa. 49.11</note> Why do many men lay up for themſelves treaſure on Earth? They know not the glory and dignity of Gods Saints; they conceive not the neceſſity and excellency of ſaving Grace; they never taſted the comforts of a godly life; ſee not the Crown and joy that is

It may bee they know there is a life to come, an Heaven, an Hell, but their knowledge is dim, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, confuſed, idle; earneſtly, often, adviſedly, deeply, they conſider not of it: It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that hee ſhould covet great things in this world, or highly prize what is baſe, and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that hath an eye to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward.

               <hi>The words of the wiſe are as goads,</hi> if the Word read or preached bee of great force, it muſt needs work effectually, if wee joyn Meditation. Upon the firſt hearing, the practice of good works may ſeem difficult, and unpleaſant; our ſlothful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will object many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; A Lion is in the way; a Lion is in the ſtreet; it is hard to bee tied ſo narrowly, dangerous to follow ſuch courſes: But if wee conſider the matter more attentively, wee ſhall ſee great cauſe, good incouragement to ſet upon that work with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, joy, and chearfulneſs; as the mercies of God, the love of Chriſt, the comforts of grace, the bond of Creation, preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, redemption, the promiſe of divine aſſiſtance, and gracious

            <p>Fourthly,

            <p>The reaſon is, becauſe wee are not ſtored with good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wee have not ſeen into the manifold imperfections of our hearts, nor tried in ſecret how wee can maſter and overcome corruptions. Whereby the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Meditation is manifeſt,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170506:26"/>that gaging the heart thorowly, and fighting againſt ſin at home, wee might bee more watchful in company, leſt wee ſhould bee overtaken, and better enabled to reſiſt; for as hee who goeth to war, is firſt trained, and made fit to uſe his weapon at home, and the ſcholar tryeth maſteries privately, before hee come forth to diſpute openly; ſo muſt a good Chriſtian try what hee can do againſt his affections, &amp; luſts, alone by himſelf, in his ſolitary Meditation, and reſolve againſt them (accordingly as hee ſeeth the difficulty to require) before hee can in his common dealings with all ſorts and companies, bee ſtrengthened againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and falls, and free from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence-giving in his words and deeds.</p>

            <p>The ſpecial remedy is earneſt communication with our ſelves, and with the Lord in ſecret. How doth the heart relent when wee ſet our ſelves in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, to record our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience with ſhame, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and when wee call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance our mortality, the day of death, the coming of Chriſt to judgement, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God, the love of Chriſt, his moſt bitter death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?

            <p>Thirdly,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Frequent and daily repetition, and regard of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, brings us to better and more inward acquaintance with God, moſt comfortable fellowſhip and communion with him.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> To call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the Lords mercies of old, and his free promiſes that never fail, is a ſingular eaſe and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the time of temptation; when Satan doth ſift and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now us with <hi>temptations,</hi>

            <p>Eleventhly, As the mind is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> ſuch is the life; for that is the fountain of actions (whether good or evil) if the mind bee pure, the life is holy, if the mind bee defiled, the actions cannot bee upright; Wouldeſt thou live a Chriſtian life, and injoy thoſe great liberties which God affords to his children in this life? then thou muſt ſcatter the bed of diſordered cogitations, and nouriſh godly deſires, and motions in their room; medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Law of God, doth bring on the doing of it, even as evil thoughts do bring on evil actions; for the thought is as the ſeed, and conception of all our actions: Now look as after conception there is a travel to bring forth, and a birth in due ſeaſon: ſo when the ſoul by thought hath conceived, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

            <p>Twelfthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Meditation fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for conference; hee that hath digeſted good matter by ſerious cogitation, ſtudy, and care, is able to bring it forth, and utter it (as occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) As they that have treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up much gold and ſilver, can eaſily lay it out, when it may bee to their advantage; whereas others that after long ſtudy can ſpeak excellently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to it upon the ſudden, can ſay little for lack of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; herein like unto them, that having laid up nothing in ſtore, are compelled to borrow of the Uſurers, before they can make their purchaſe.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:170506:33"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If formerly thou haſt been a ſtranger to this exerciſe, now learn it, begin to practiſe it, entertain not conceits, as though it were needleſs, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, impoſſible, burdenſome; for a Chriſtian life cannot ſtand without it; Thou ſhalt finde it exceeding beneficial, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, eaſie, when thou art en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it; it is tedious onely to corruption, to the heart renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170506:34"/>it is moſt ſweet and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: The neglect of this duty is the very cauſe why many Chriſtians injoy not the tenth part of thoſe priviledges that God hath provided for them in this their pilgrimage: why they are kept under their ſtrong cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and break forth offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively in their dealings in the world: Moreover, how ſhould a man bee aſſured of Gods love, if knowing this to bee a duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, hee never addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto it in good earneſt. It is not ſufficient to praiſe that which is good, ſpeak well of the children of God, keep our ſelves pure from the groſs ſtains of the time, but we muſt hate iniquity, and love righteouſneſs, which they do not, who harbour ſuch thoughts as are diſpleaſing to his Majeſty: How can a purified
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170506:34"/>mind take pleaſure in thoſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy waters that flow from the ſtinking puddle of original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? It is for ſwine to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the mire, and corrupt fountains to ſend forth muddy ſtreams. If the treaſure bee in Heaven, the heart muſt be there; If the ſoul bee of an heavenly diſpoſition, nothing is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful than to walk, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with God. By thy thoughts thou mayeſt know thy ſelf; as evil thoughts will argue an evil heart, ſo good thoughts will argue a good heart: for theſe cannot bee ſubject to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, as words, and deeds are, which ſometimes come more from reſpect of the creature, than of the Creator. It is the will of God that wee ſhould not onely ſeek the Kingdome of Heaven, but, minde it, ſet our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170506:35"/>thoughts upon it, and turn the bent of our deſires wholly that way.
<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 6.19 Col. 3.1</note> The Lord hath given to us the great things of his Law,

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The chief praiſe of this duty, is, that wee be much in its uſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.97. &amp; 1.2.</note> from time to time, through the whole courſe of our life, and every day thereof, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording holy and divine things, eſpecially thoſe which tend to ſoundneſs in the matter of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little time more or leſs (as opportunity is offered, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions will permit) may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed of us, to dry up fleſhly, and bad humours of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, and worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c. and to quicken our dull hearts, leſt after ſleep in ſin, the Devil draw us to deep forgetfulneſs and ſecurity.

            <p>Nor is this work ſleightly to bee gone about, wee muſt ſet our hearts to the cogitation of heavenly things, thorowly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, and reaſoning them with our ſelves, ſo far as wee are able, that wee might bee inabled to order our lives, as well in one
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170506:37"/>ſtate, as another, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the aſſaults of Satan, and allurements of this preſent evil world: Meditation is a weighty matter, and great pity that works of greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould finde the moſt ſleight regard. It is the work of the Lord, wherein remiſs deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is condemned as injurious to God, hurtful to our ſelves.
<note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 48.10</note> The fruit of Meditation ſtands in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency; hee that is not ſerious ſhall reap no profit: How ſhould the Word ſink into our ſtony hearts, if it bee not minded? how ſhould mercy, or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affect, if wee dwell not upon the thought of them? The heart muſt bee preſſed, before it will relent, and fixed upon things above, before it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in them. Meditation is one part of a Chriſtian mans

<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 13.18. Col. 1.10.</note> pleaſe God, to be teachable, and ready to any duty; I have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed my ſelf againſt mine own will, and the Devils ſecret, and malicious counſel (though ſweet to the fleſh)
<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8.12.</note> I am not a debtor unto it, how can I then yeeld to the untowardneſs of my heart, and to ſin againſt my God I have taſted the fatneſs and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the houſe of God, and ſhall I return to feed upon the husks of the world? where are the manifold and comfortable priviledges which he hath given mee, that I might bee faithful
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170506:40"/>unto him? Am I weary of my own peace, and do I haſte after my own ſorrow? what pleaſure can I finde in vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? what taſte in the white of an egg? Lord bring back this ranging heart of mine from the deceitful dreams and fears that it hath been ſnared in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to the liberty that it was wont to injoy, that is, to ſolace it ſelf in thy favour and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with thee. And this gift being decayed, through my own fault, and Satans cruelty and ſubtilty forgive my cold and weak love of thee, who have provoked thy Majeſty (if thou wouldeſt bee provoked) to frown, and look amiably on mee no more: Thou Lord chargeſt mee thus to ſeek thy face, and ſweet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which I have gone from, and for a time been blinded, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170506:41"/>having no ability to muſe of any good thing, and have not ſeen that I was ſeduced, till I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I had loſt this ſweet liborty. Now therefore, O Lord, ſhew thy loving kindneſs in my diſtreſs and weakneſs, and reſtore to mee this liberty of my heart, which many of thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do finde and enjoy. Thus fall into conſideration with thy ſelf, and bee not diſcouraged when thou ſeeſt thy infirmities, who haſt learned to uſe all thy wants to humble thee, and to bring thee nearer to God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to go further from him: but let no man give any liberty in any ſort to his evil heart (when it is turned away from chearfulneſs and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in any part of Gods ſervice) to go forward therein, for that were to bring himſelf into utter bondage.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:170506:41"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is a ſecond Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment or Let?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Inconſtancy; when wee begin to ſet upon this duty, but are drawn aſide by the love of vanity, or diſcouraged by the difficulty of the exerciſe, and ſo give over, and never ſet about it in good earneſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Remedy of this Impediment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Labour to be conſtant, and if it bee poſſible, let no day paſs without ſome line of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though many blocks be caſt into the way. Impediments will multiply, as wee give way unto them; indiſpoſition and unfitneſs get ſtrength through omiſſion, and delay; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and courage (our break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow all oppoſition) with careful watchfulneſs to tye up our thoughts, will make this
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170506:42"/>exerciſe in time, not onely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but eaſie, and pleaſant. It is grievous for children at the firſt to go to ſchool, but after they have taſted the ſweetneſs of ſtudy, and tried the fruit, they are contented to leave country and kindred for love of learning: So the entrance into this exerciſe is hard and tedious, but the progreſs full of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight and contentation; nay, it is grievous to bee peſtered with vain, wicked, idle thoughts, whereby communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. In the world it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a hard thing to bee bound with cords and chains of Iron, to bee vexed with Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an inſupportable burthen, what is it then to bee bound with chains of our corruption, to live under the power of luſt,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170506:42"/>to bee toſſed to and fro with the temptations of Satan? let us therefore ſet apart the fitteſt time for this exerciſe, eſpecially on the Sabbath (when ſpiritual idleneſs is as bad, or worſe than bodily labour) and to keep it conſtantly, not giving over (when wee have once begun) till wee finde that it hath done our hearts ſome good: For what will it avail us to knock at the door of our hearts, if wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part before wee have an anſwer?</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>May not a man ſpend too much time in private Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, no doubt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, who are ſo addicted to their own private devotions, that they neglect other duties of Chriſtianity, and of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular callings, the neglect of which, beſides that it is a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170506:43"/>of thoſe things which God hath joyned together, doth not inlighten and quicken the mind, but rather (by the juſt judgement of God) blinde and dull it. Hence it proceeded, that the antient Monks ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bodily labour with Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proved excellent, whereas the Popiſh Monks, mured up in their Cloyſters, and exempted from bodily labour, proved the moſt noiſome Caterpillers in the world. Wherefore wee muſt ſo chuſe our times for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this exerciſe, that God bee not diſhonoured, nor our brethren wronged, by the neglect of others. The object of this exerciſe being ſpiritual, is far too excellent for the weak ſight of man to bee gazing on continually.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the third Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many are hindered and kept back from this duty, for want of matter. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great variety of matter, which the word, and works of God, and the due conſideration of their own eſtate might mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto them, yet their hearts are ſo barren, and their heads ſo empty, that they are utterly to ſeek about what to beſtow their time, and their cogitations.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the Remedy againſt this Let?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The help is to bewail and lament the barrenneſs of their hearts, and to enforce themſelves to read, and hear the Word, and to mark, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the works of God with greater care, conſcience, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and attention, than they have done in former times. How a Chriſtian is to furniſh
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170506:44"/>himſelf with good matter, wee ſhall ſhew hereafter more fully. But for the preſent, every man that is deſirous to ſet upon this exerciſe, may propound theſe things to bee thought upon.</p>

            <p>Laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Let him conſider of the outward bleſſings that God vouchſafeth unto him, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant care, and fatherly prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over him, in his going out, and coming in, providing him meat, drink, and apparel, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Want of leiſure and opportunity, by reaſon of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary buſineſs taking up the time.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:170506:45"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How is this to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Men muſt know, that the ordinary works of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are not to put this duty out of place, for if they do, it is by the unskilfulneſs, or unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of them, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this fault; but the one of them is appointed of God to go with the other, and both of them to ſtand together to the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one another. If any through neceſſary occaſion and hinderances, ſhall be conſtrained to let paſs this duty of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when otherwiſe hee would have ſet upon it, hereby let it appear to have been neceſſarily paſſed by, and without his fault: if hee ſupply the want of this duty after his neceſſary labour ended, and take heed that in no wiſe it bee omitted altogether,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170506:45"/>unleſs hee can bee aſſured with peace, that God in the omitting of it hath been remembred an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably ſome other way.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What ſhould move us to bee careful to take time for this duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe wee are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorted by the Apoſtle <hi>to redeem the time,</hi> that is, to take the opportunity, and lay hold on all occaſions whereby wee may glorifie God, or do good to others, and to our own ſouls. And the ſpecial ſpur to provoke us to make choice of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to keep ſome time to the performance of this duty, and to break thorow the manifold lets and impediments, which ſtand in our way, is the due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the fruits, and effects of this duty carefully perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which have been mentioned
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170506:46"/>before, and come to bee named hereafter.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What things do hinder the fruitful performance of this duty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Two principally, which may bee called abuſes of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Sleightneſs; when wee make a ceremony of it, not ſo much looking how our hearts are affected in and by it, as that wee may not juſtly bee charged for omitting it.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Trifling fantaſies, and worldly cares, which fill the head, that wee cannot minde heavenly things; hence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wearineſs of it, and an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening to more liberty, that our hearts may range where they liſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are theſe abuſes to bee remedied?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:170506:46"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, We muſt remember,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that it is a duty of great weight, earneſtly called for at our hands, of ſingular fruit, and comfort, worthy to bee delighted in, and exerciſed with greateſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The men of the world are exact in trifles, is it not a ſhame to the children of God, if they be ſleighty in matters of ſo great importance? Labour ſpent in the duties of Religion is loſt, and the fruit periſheth, if wee ſtrive not to perform them with life and power.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To obtain,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that we may bee fit to perform this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not to bee carried at that time after wandring, wee muſt tye up our looſe hearts through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day from the deadly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ranging after vain, fond, and deceiveable thoughts, dreams, and delights; wee muſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170506:47"/>weigh how little worth this is to ſuffer our cogitations to bee faſtened on things tranſitory with delight, much leſs about thoſe that are filthy, and evil, but rather bring them to bee taken up in thoſe which are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: This wee are called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and until wee learn, how weighty ſoever our dealings be, to count this the chiefeſt, to keep peace with God, and ever fear to offend him, it will bee an hard matter to bring our ſelves to meditate with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fruit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When thou ſetteſt upon this duty, take heed of ſelf-confidence, leſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to give thee up to be buffeted of Satan, to teach thee humility, and lowlineſs. How ſhould wee hope to proſper in any good work, ſo long as wee
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170506:47"/>truſt in our own ſtrength? Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs joyned with ſelf-preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is perillous; for it tendeth to ſpiritual fulneſs, and ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, two main and great diſeaſes of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What bee the ſorts and kinds of Divine Meditation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is fitly divided into two ſorts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Extemporary,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or ſudden, which may bee done at all times, and in all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Set, deliberate,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or ſolemn: both theſe have their uſe, and in both theſe, ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is required.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is occaſional Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a ſerious bending of the mind, to think upon ſome good and profitable ſubject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſioned thereunto by ſuch
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170506:48"/>things as (by the providence of God) do offer themſelves to our ſenſes,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.8. Joh. 4.10. Prov. 6.6. Mat. 6.26.</note> eyes, and ears, as wee go about the duties of our calling, or bee exerciſed in ſome honeſt, and lawful Recreation, for the continuance of our health, and comfort of our life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What Rules are to bee noted touching this extemporary Meditation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Extemporary Meditation, as Ejaculatory Prayers, have no ornament but fervency, no motive but love, no other eloquence but affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their clauſes, no contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> No employment can hinder us from this duty, they rather miniſter occaſion thereof unto us: The cold of Winter, the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the ſweetneſs of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170506:48"/>Spring, the fruitfulneſs of the Harveſt, do
<note n="*" place="margin">Pſa. 19.1. &amp; 69.34. &amp; 89.5. Pſa. 8.3, 4.</note> praiſe the Lord, that is, do miniſter plentiful oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to us to praiſe God: No month in the year, nor week in the month, nor day in the week, nor hour in the day, which doth not afford us ſome profitable matter to meditate upon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The fitteſt day in the week, is the Lords day, which wee are to conſecrate wholly to him: but as no perſon is exempted from this duty, ſo no time but may fitly ſerve for the performance thereof.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As wee muſt not lightly let ſlip ſuch matters of good uſe, as will bee often of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto us, and defraud our ſelves, and others of the benefit thereof; ſo wee muſt not fix our minds too earneſtly upon them, leſt wee offend others, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170506:49"/>ſome neceſſary duty of our own.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The more natural and lively the occaſion of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Meditation is, the better it doth affect at the firſt ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſoon as wee take a taſte of it, which muſt bee regarded and laboured after, becauſe the buſineſs of this life will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us largely to diſcourſe upon them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Variety of matter is very profitable, for often itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame thing, breeds heartleſneſs. It is with Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as with medicines, which with over ordinary uſe loſe their ſoveraignty, and kill in ſtead of purging.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the benefits of Extemporary Meditation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 It fits for ſetled Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, as it furniſheth with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170506:49"/>matter, and prepareth the heart to commune with God: as oft ſalutations makes way to fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conference. Hee that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the Lord in all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and makes ſpiritual uſe of earthly things, ſhall with more eaſe finde and faſten his heart upon ſome good matter, and have it at command, to attend upon the Lord in moſt ſerious Communication.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It kindles the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit, which might otherwiſe bee damped with the foggy miſts of earthly cares, and vain delights. As the fire gathers that which cauſeth it to burn faſter: ſo the Spirit raiſeth holy thoughts upon outward occaſions, which do revive the grace wee have received.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Since the greateſt part of our life is ſpent in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170506:50"/>affairs, unleſs wee lift up our hearts to God upon occaſions offered in our callings, journies, and ſuch like, wee ſhall deprive our ſouls for the moſt part of ſweet fellowſhip, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and company with the Lord.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> If God walk along with us in the labours of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, is it not an offence in us to take no notice, or obſervation of his preſence?</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Occaſional Meditation is a ſharp ſpur, and ſtrong provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to prayer and praiſe: Hee cannot want matter of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving or ſupplication, that conſcionably obſerveth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth the goodneſs of the Lord towards him in the things of this life, and infirmities of the creature, and his own inability of himſelf to effect, or bring any thing to paſs.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:170506:50"/>
            <p>Sixthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> It furthers much to bring us to the knowledge of our ſelves, and to encreaſe humility: ſelf-ignorance is a diſeaſe moſt dangerous, the daughter of corruption, infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, forgetfulneſs, pride, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, earthly-mindedneſs, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, bad company, ill examples, and cuſtome in ſin. One ſpecial Remedy of this over-ſpreading malady is oft and diligent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the things that ſhall happen, fall out, or be preſented to us in our daily vocations.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The thoughts of this nature are not onely lawful, but ſo behooveful, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit them without neglect of God, his creatures, our ſelves; the creatures are half loſt, if wee onely imploy them, not learn ſomething of them, God is wronged, if his creatures bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170506:51"/>our ſelves moſt of all, if wee read this great volume of the creatures, and take out no leſſon for our inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhould a man fit himſelf for extemporary Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Hee muſt get an heart deſirous to reap profit by every thing that doth befall him. Love of wealth draws the covetous to ſtudy how he might turn all things to his advantage, and love of grace will produce the ſame effects in her kind.</p>
            <p>Secondly,

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The matter of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation muſt be ſome good and profitable thing: as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his attributes, titles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, works of mercy, and

            <p>But out of this variety, make choice of ſome one to bee the ſubject of thy diſcourſe, for hee that is every where, is no where: Nothing is more hurtful to the body, than many medicines. The ſore, to which ſundry kinds of plaiſters are applied, is hardly brought to a ſcar.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nihil tam utile eſt quod in tranſitu profit.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nec.</note> Think upon one thing until thy affections be wrought upon. Nothing is ſo profitable, that it can benefit much in paſſing by; hee that comes by the fire may feel a glympſe of heat, hee onely is warmed that tarrieth at it: It is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170506:54"/>the property of a weak ſtomach to taſte many things, to hold and digeſt nothing. Many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thruſt upon us at once, weaken and diſtract the powers of the ſoul. To ſcatter the thoughts upon many things, is to attend nothing as it ought: when the mind is diſtracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt divers things, the one is a hinderance to the other, and we receive benefit by neither, nor bring our thoughts to any good iſſue.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Out of this variety of matter, ſeeing thou muſt take but ſome one, play the part of a wiſe man, and chuſe that whereof thou haſt ſpecial need: As ſalves are not for every ſore, nor all meats agreeable to every conſtitution; every part of the Word is holy, pure, and good; but times, occaſions, conditions

The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, diſeaſes, comforts of Chriſtians are not the ſame, nor alike at all times: out of the treaſury of the Word wee may gather inſtructions which will fit every occaſion, ſeaſon, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: Fitneſs of matter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as in ſpeaking, ſo in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.

            <p>Firſt,

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Hee muſt watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his heart (having been ſo often deceived by it) through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his whole life, and have it in

            <p>Thirdly,

Alſo it is good to meditate on the Glory of Gods Kingdome, the ſweet comfort of a peaceable conſcience; love of humility, meekneſs, but ſpecially that which for the preſent ſhall bee moſt ſuitable to his ſtate.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> If hee cannot thus do, let him read ſome portion of the holy Scripture, ſome part of the Pſalms, ſome of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of the Apoſtles, Chriſts Sermons, or ſome good book fit to furniſh him with good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Every part of our calling muſt bee ſo carried on, as wee may have peace thereby: and it behooveth us to bee beſt armed, and moſt circumſpect,

            <p>If a man bee fallen, hee muſt not lye ſtill, but return unto the Lord with ſpeed, though with much difficulty: for ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deadneſs will follow, if the breach bee not made up in our conſciences,

            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> In croſſes we muſt uſe great ſobriety, otherwiſe wee ſhall be unſettled by them, eſpecially if they bee many and great, to this end wee muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

            <p>Fifthly,

            <p>Sixthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The moſt vexations in our life become annoyances unto us through our own fault, in that wee either prevent them not when wee may, or bear them not as wee ought, or make not uſe of them as wee might do.</p>
            <p>Seventhly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> When matters of more importance than our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation come into place, let us bee occupied with more ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in them, than in that, but not before.
<note place="margin">Prov. 3.14.</note> The practice of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a rich and gainful trade, but if it bee not well followed, it will bring no great profit.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:170506:59"/>
            <p>Eighthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> To have a willing mind to bee well occupied, and matter about which wee may, and time to beſtow therein, and freedome from lets therefrom, is an eſtate to bee much made of, and yet for the moſt part, they which have moſt outward incouragements, cannot tell what to do with them.</p>
            <p>Ninthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Whatſoever mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of graces wee have gotten, yet it is certain, that God hath much more than wee can think of, if thoſe bee the matters which we have in greateſt price: but being ſet light by, and the means neglected (which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them) they dye. That is a good ſtate when wee have not onely joy in heavenly things at the firſt hearing of them, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in joy as our knowledge and experience increaſeth: and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170506:60"/>when wee are not onely delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preſent duties of Gods ſervice, but alſo as joyful to think of them that are to come; accounting that the more they bee, the better they are.

            <p>Tenthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Love of the world makes death terrible, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting in pleaſure lulleth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.

            <p>Eleventhly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> The more ſure thou art of Gods favour by Faith,
<note place="margin">Mat. 15.27</note> the more humble thou art alſo: One ſpecial point of profiting, is to know our own vileneſs and miſery better daily, that ſo wee may come to know the ineſtimable bounty of God the better, and what wee are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him for, as receiving increaſe from him, multiplied pardons of ſin, and daily increaſe of grace.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> They are worthy of great puniſhment, who ſet light by the plenty of grace, the crumms whereof Gods hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſervants do ſet great ſtore

The more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that thou haſt, take heed thou beeſt not more ſecure: for thus it is with many at this day, who therefore do ſmart for it: wee ſhall not injoy the grace we had at firſt, except wee bee as careful now to keep it, as wee were then to come by it.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> When wee are afflicted, and the wicked ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, our eſtate ſeems to them moſt vile, when wee are both in proſperity, they ſeem more happy: when they and wee bee both afflicted, then they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count our eſtate happier than their own, but eſpecially when
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170506:61"/>they bee afflicted,
<note place="margin">Exod. 14.25.</note> and wee ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Wee may not aſſign the Lord in what place and ſtate, in what condition and company we ſhould live, but as ſtrangers wait on him, even as the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid on her Miſtreſs, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee will allow us: wee are ready moſt commonly to bee called away by death, before wee have learned how to live.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170506:62"/>in a godly courſe, by what occaſions, or weighty dealings ſoever it bee, the Devil hath met with us; therefore wee muſt ſpeedily take ſhame and ſorrow, and turn unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ſerve and walk with God,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 90.12</note> by daies, not by weeks, and months onely. A great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betwixt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and viewing of our life from day to day, and the doing of it by fits now and then; in the one wee are ſafe, chearful, and fruitful, in the other raſh, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, and often unquiet for it, walking in fear, and with little comfort.</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> As husbandmen wait for their fruit, ſo ſhould wee for that which wee pray, and hope for; and that would make us joyful when wee obtain

<note place="margin">Luke 15.6.</note> then is hee the friend of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Seventeenthly, It is a folly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> yea, a madneſs to bee heavy to the death for any earthly thing, when yet a man deſireth nothing more than life. They who can neglect, and ſet meanly by a little vain glory, and credit with men, may gain, and injoy much peace with God. All our life ought to bee a providing for a good end, and a keeping away of woe, which cometh by ſin, fear not the pain of death, for God can make it eaſie, or tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>Eighteenthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> The fleſh would fain pleaſe it ſelf in ſome unlawful liberty, when we have pleaſed God in ſome duties: but a wiſe man will keep him well while hee is well.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is their ſin, that they will thus ſet God againſt himſelf, as though hee ſhould command them to do that which hindereth them from another duty commanded: God hath appointed unto us our ſeveral ſtandings in our general, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal callings, they are both of him, and the duties belonging to them both will excellently ſtand together, if the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God bee not contrary.

If wee bee rich, wee have the leſs cauſe to bee holden from Meditation by wordly cares. If poor, wee have the more need of this duty to moderate our care, that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not, nor carry us to unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef; What example ſoever wee have of the contrary in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of worldlings among whom wee live, yet wee muſt know, though others will not, that wee are not ſet here in our places to do as looſe, and wretched ſervants, who when

            <p>Queſt. <hi>What courſe must bee holden to redeem time out of the world for Meditation?</hi>

            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Order the affairs of this life wiſely, that every thing may have its fit time and ſeaſon: wee have ſufficient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for the diſpatch of all our labours, if wee take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170506:72"/>and manage both work, and means with diſcretion. If thy heart bee upright, fear not,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.10</note> God will teach thee how to walk. To the man that is good in his ſight, God giveth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, knowledge, and joy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Spend not much time either in conſulting private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with thy ſelf, or by talking, in company with others, about that whereof there is no uſe, or which may bee done and ended in a little ſpace.</p>
            <p>Thoughts of the world do tickle us, and that may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in a few ſentences, and in a part of an hour, which may (if wee take not heed) hold us work the moſt part of a day.

The Heathen began

Of our ſelves wee are not able to think one good thought, and if in preſumption of our wit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, memory, learning, or any thing beſide, wee ſet upon this work, the ſucceſs is like to bee anſwerable to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: without the help of God wee can do nothing that is good. The matter or form of our prayer muſt bee this, or ſuch like: Oh Lord, ſith it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee to give mee a minde ready, and deſirous to perform this holy duty (for which I humbly thank thy heavenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty) I beſeech thee by thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to aſſiſt mee therein, that I may bring the ſame to a profitable and comfortable iſſue. Thou haſt charged mee, Oh Lord, to ſeek thy face, that is, thy bleſſed and holy preſence;

            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:170506:74"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>In what order muſt wee proceed after the entrance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Wee muſt firſt travel with our judgement to inform it, and then make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that it may work upon the heart: Knowledge without affection is dead and fruitleſs, Affection without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is blinde and inordinate: All good motions ariſe from ſound judgement, and muſt bee ruled by it, elſe they will bee as a ſhip without a Governour, that is in danger to run upon the ſands, or to ſplit againſt the rocks.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For the helping of our judgement, underſtanding, invention, and memory, it is good for to call to minde (ſo far as wee can) what the Holy Ghoſt ſaith in the Scriptures of that thing which wee meditate upon, referring the particular
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170506:74"/>paſſages to the ſeveral heads, or places of reaſon. This is a great help to lead us along in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with more eaſe and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and to furniſh us more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with profitable matter, touching the point wee meditate upon; as the marks ſet up in the high-way, direct a traveller in his intended journey; yet wee muſt not be curious, nor ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous herein, for that would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract the mind, and draw us too much from the right end of this holy exerciſe, which is not to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Logick, but to exerciſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to kindle piety, and devotion. And therefore it ſhall bee our wiſdome to take ſuch places or heads only, as are moſt pregnant, and ready at hand, and do more eaſily offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our mind. But this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot bee preſcribed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170506:75"/>but as profitable only. In this wee muſt labour with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and ſincerity, that the underſtanding, or memory, may bee bettered, or confirmed, but the method is left free, as each man ſhall finde it moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Our proceeding to inform the mind cannot bee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one manner in all things. We muſt obſerve one thing in our Meditation of God, another of his Works; one of good Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, another of our Sins: one thing when wee meditate on ſimple theams, another when wee conſider of an intire ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. This ſhall bee in a good meaſure made clear by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereafter following.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Application is the life of Meditation; for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of knowledge, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170506:75"/>ſtrenthening of memory, is vain and to little purpoſe, unleſs the affection bee reformed and kindled. It is not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil, but the hearty, and unfeigned affecting of the one, with a zealous dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the other, that makes us holy, and happy. Wee muſt therefore indeavour to have a ſenſible taſte, lively touch, and feeling of that whereof wee have diſcourſed with our ſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former direction, that wee may bee affected either with godly joy, or godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, godly hope, or godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The affections to be quickened, are divers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the thing meditated upon. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if wee meditate on God, or any of his mercies, or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170506:76"/>benefits, wee muſt labour with our hearts and affections to feel how ſweet the Lord is; that as doting Lovers do inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a carnal delight in thinking and ſpeaking of them whom they ſo love, and of the letters, and tokens they have received from them: So wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſpiritual joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by thinking and ſpeaking of the Lord, and of his mercies towards us.</p>
            <p>Again, if wee meditate on ſin according to the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, wee muſt labour to feel <hi>the plague in our own hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 8. Jer. 2.19.</note> 
               <hi>and to know, that it is an evil thing, and bitter, to forſake the Lord our God, and not to have his fear in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, The chief things to bee obſerved for the quickening and affecting of the heart, are theſe.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170506:76"/>
            <p n="1">1 Trial, examination and communing with our ſelves, wherein wee have offended, or come ſhort of our duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Taking ſhame to our ſelves for our tranſgreſſions, joyned with lamentable, and doleful complaining, and bewailing of our own eſtate, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſin that aboundeth, or the grace that is wanting.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A moſt paſſionate, vehement, earneſt, and hearty longing after the removal of this ſin, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which wee hate, and obtaining the good things which wee love.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Religious quickening and calling upon our ſouls, by many ſtrong and forcible reaſons, to hate evil, and follow that which is good.</p>
            <p>The fifth is an humble, and unfeigned acknowledgement,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170506:77"/>and confeſſion of our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inability, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the evil, or obtain the good, proceeding from a broken and contrite heart.</p>
            <p>The ſixth is fervent Petition, earneſtly craving, and begging this at the hands of God, who is only able to effect it.</p>
            <p>The laſt is chearful confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, raiſing and rouſing up our ſouls, after ſuch doleful complaining, hearty wiſhing, humble confeſſing, unfeigned acknowledging, and ſerious ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up our ſelves, and earneſt craving of what wee want, grounded upon the moſt ſweet, and ſure Promiſes of God, made to them that call upon him in Faith, and upon the experience which the Saints of God in all ages have had of the ſucceſs of their ſutes, who were never ſent
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170506:77"/>empty away, but either obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that thing which they beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or that which was much better for them; but theſe things are ſpecially obſerved in Meditation upon ſome grace, or ſin, as will bee made more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and plain, by examples, and are not ever neceſſary, that they ſhould bee particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is to bee obſerved for concluſion of this exerciſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> We muſt begin when the heart is fitly diſpoſed, or at leaſt labour to bring it into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, before wee ſet upon this duty, and break off before the ſpirits bee dulled, and tired, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhall loſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſweetneſs of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is not good ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, or abruptly, to break off, except ſome unavoidable neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170506:78"/>of company or buſineſs do urge us thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The concluſion of this exerciſe conſiſts principally in theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Hearty thankſgiving to God, that hath vouchſafed in ſuch gracious meaſure to aſſiſt us in the performing of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Recommending our ſelves, and our waies to him, that our life, and carriage, and all our thoughts, and actions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, may bee anſwerable to thoſe heavenly thoughts and deſires which wee have had, and expreſs in the performing of this duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Renewing our covenant to live by Faith, and to walk with God in all holy converſation.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Declare this by ſome example, and first, how ſhould wee
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170506:78"/>meditate on God his infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Entrance may be made thus into it. Oh Lord, my heart deſires to commune with thee, that I might come into better acquaintance with thy Majeſty; but of my ſelf I have no ability to conceive what is right, or to think a good thought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy highneſs: Teach mee therefore, Oh gracious God, if not to comprehend thine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, for that is impoſſible, yet ſo to confer with thee, that I may apprehend in ſome meaſure how thou haſt revealed thy ſelf, and what thou wilt bee unto mee: that knowing thee in thy power, goodneſs, truth, ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and grace, I may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly cleave unto thee all the daies of my life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How muſt wee proceed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170506:79"/>in this Meditation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt conſider of his titles, properties, and works, obſerving how infinitely hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth what excellency ſoever is in any, or all the creatures in the world.
<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.16. 1 Joh. 4.12. Exod. 33.20.</note> 
               <hi>Oh Lord, thou dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt in the light unapproachable, whom man never ſaw, neither can ſee and live;</hi> thou art incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible by reaſon, and unname<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by words, thy name is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and thy nature ſecret, I cannot comprehend what thou art, I will labour to know what thou haſt revealed; I am not able to behold thy face, let mee ſee thy back-parts, for this is my life, and joy of heart to know thee the onely true God, which ſpringeth, and increaſeth daily as I come to the fuller know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thee: and ſhall bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, becauſe thou art infinite.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170506:79"/>
            <p>I beleeve as thou haſt taught mee (according to my manner, and meaſure) that thou art a Spirit, without beginning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, the firſt and abſolute being, living in and of thy ſelf; giving being and life to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; infinite, eternal, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible,
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note> without compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one in eſſence, and three in perſons; moſt perfect, a meer act, bleſſed, and glorious: all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in thy ſelf, for us a great reward, void of all poſſibility to bee what thou art not; great in power, infinite in wiſdome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in goodneſs, everlaſting in compaſſion, rich in mercy, faithful, ſincere, conſtant in thy promiſes, unchangeable in thy love, gentle, eaſie to bee entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, juſt and righteous in all thy Commandements, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: the moſt abſolute, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170506:80"/>ſoveraignty of all things both in Heaven and Earth: Thy name is wonderful in all the world, for thou haſt created all things, and by thy appointment they continue unto this day. Thou haſt laid the foundation of the earth, and it abideth, thou haſt ſtretched forth the heavens, as a curtain,
<note place="margin">Job 9.7, 8, &amp;c.</note> and in them or dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Tabernacle for the Sun. Thou ſtilleſt the raging of the Sea, and the proud waves are quelled by thy command: the day is thine, the night alſo is thine, the Moon and Stars are the work of thine hands: Thou thundereſt from Heaven by thy voice, and bringeſt the winds out of their treaſure; thou breakeſt up the deep, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt the ſprings to aſcend in the vallies. Thou cauſeſt the graſs to grow upon the mountains,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170506:80"/>and ſatisfieſt with thy goodneſs every living thing. The earth, Oh Lord, is full of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but thy glory ſhines moſt bright in the aſſembly of thy Saints. Oh what wiſdome, power, grace, mercy, love, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering haſt thou manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt, the brightneſs of thy glory, the image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God? what great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things haſt thou done for thy people? thou haſt reconciled them being enemies, redeemed them being bond-ſlaves, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them being ſinners, of vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of Satan thou haſt adopted them to bee thy ſons, of unclean and polluted, thou haſt waſhed, and made them clean: Thou guardeſt them with thy Angels, protecteſt them againſt dangers, feedeſt them with fatneſs, and marrow, and haſt reſerved for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170506:81"/>them the Kingdome of Heaven. All thy Works praiſe thee, Oh Lord, and thy Saints bleſs thee.</p>
            <p>Great is the power, wiſdome, holineſs, and glory of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Angels, but they are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, created, dependent; great, immortal, glorious by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, not able to behold the glory of God; great is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, dignity, dominion of earthly Monarchs, but their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are mortal, their glory fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, their Dominion tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their power limited, what they are, they have by deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, during pleaſure: As for our God, hee is an infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, abſolute, independent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign: <hi>His Kingdome is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Kingdome, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion endureth throughout all ages,</hi>

I know very little of thy waies, much leſs of thy nature; yea what thou haſt revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of thy ſelf in thy Word, doth rather make known what thou wilt bee to thy people, than what thou art in thy ſelf. <hi>As the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are thy waies higher than our waies, and thy thoughts than our thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are theſe things to bee laid to heart, and preſſed upon the ſoul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt ſtir up our ſelves to deſire full knowledge of God, and free communion with him, to truſt, love, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,

Bleſſed is the man that knoweth the Lord, and cleaveth unto him in love, fear, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance: yea happy is the man whoſe God is the Lord. Look unto God, Oh my ſoul, obſerve his waies, ſeek his face, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after more intire fellowſhip and familiarity with him. The knowledge of God is excellent, eaſie, comfortable, it perfecteth the underſtanding, ſeaſoneth the will, changeth the affections, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth the heart. The worth, and excellency, the profit, and delight that knowledge bringeth, is anſwerable to the object which is apprehended, in which the knowledge of God hath infinitely the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. Nothing can rejoyce the heart, in which the goodneſs of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170506:82"/>God is not felt, nor his power, wiſdome and mercy ſeen: Oh how ſweet and delightſome is it to behold the face of God as it ſhineth in Jeſus Chriſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the happy Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice and mercy, by his unſearchable wiſdome, to think upon his long-ſuffering, tender love, and never-fading compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! Love the Lord, Oh my ſoul, and truſt in his mercie, ſerve him with fear, and rejoyce in his holy name, for hee is thy ſtrength, thy rock, thy portion, thy ſalvation. His favour is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life; in his preſence is fulneſs of joy; hee is goodneſs it ſelf, the highneſs of all good things that can bee deſired. The pleaſures of the world are vain; earthly gain breeds great vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<note place="margin">Trial.</note> worldly honours vaniſh and come to nothing; but God is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170506:83"/>our pleaſure, glory, gain, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, immeaſurable; But woe is mee, my ſight is dimm, my judgement vain, my heart car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, my affections diſordered, my thoughts looſe, I know little of God, I have been very negligent to ſeek acquaintance with him. Theſe vain things below, the gifts of Gods bounty have ſtollen away my heart, from the giver of every good and perfect gift; If men ſpeak, I tremble, if they ſmile, I rejoyce, in their preſence I am reverent, if ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; chearful if friends; if ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I long for their company; if preſent, I deſire to give them content; if in diſtreſs, I mourn; if in proſperity, I rejoyce; when ſeparated from them in body, I am with them in ſpirit: If I bee ignorant of the things of this life, I inquire after them; if I

If the eye of the body, wherewith wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this light, bee annoyed or dimmed, wee will ſeek far and wide for help, and ſhall wee not labour to have the eye of our ſpirits cleared, wherewith we ſee the Lord, the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the light, and joy of every Chriſtian? Raiſe up thy ſelf to love, reverence, and truſt in the Lord; Thou canſt not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170506:85"/>his goodneſs, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable, his power, which is unſearchable, his truth, which is firm, and immoveable; as his infiniteneſs paſſeth thy conceit, covet the more inſeparably to cleave unto him: Couldeſt thou comprehend his nature, hee ſhould not bee all-ſufficient in himſelf, nor able to ſatisfie thy deſire: But as God is infinite, and never to bee comprehended eſſentially; ſo is our joy in him bottomleſs, our help from him moſt certain, and our love to him ſhould bee above meaſure, our confidence in him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering.

            <p>Queſt. <hi>Let the holy Angels be a ſecond instance; how are wee to proceed in the Meditation of that ſubject?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt conſider their author, nature, properties, eſtate, end, and offices.</p>
            <p>The Angels are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than man, but inferiour to the Almighty, from whom they received their being in time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good pleaſure, and by whoſe goodneſs ſuch as abode in the truth were ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their being, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed condition.</p>
            <p>The truth hath taught us to define them to bee ſpirits, finite, compleat, immortal, made after the Image of God, who through his grace and goodneſs abode ſtill in the eſtate of innocency and bleſſedneſs; they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170506:86"/>ſpirits, limited in eſſence, compounded of ſubject and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, act and poſſibility, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal by participation, mutable by creation, but eſtabliſhed by grace in their firſt ſtate.</p>
            <p>As ſpirits, they are inviſible, immaterial, incorruptible, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent; as chief inſtruments of Gods providence, they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with great power, incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſwiftneſs, ſingular wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, burning zeal, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted faithfulneſs; as bleſſed Miniſters that ever attend his Throne, they are indued with clear knowledge of God, ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable love, exceeding joy, and admirable glory.</p>
            <p>Their life is ſpiritual, their ſtate bleſſed, and permanent, for they ſtand ever in the preſence of God, behold his glory, and reſt in him with full delight.</p>
            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:170506:87"/>
            <p>Their End, and office, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, is to praiſe his Name, and execute his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; in reſpect of Chriſt, to miniſter, and attend upon him; in regard of men, to rejoyce at the converſion of a ſinner, to guard and protect the faithful againſt the dangers of this life, and the aſſaults of Satan, to curb, bridle, and deſtroy their enemies, and to gather the elect together at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are theſe things to bee preſſed, and urged, and applied unto the heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Wee muſt ſtir up our ſelves to admire the power, goodneſs, and glory of God in himſelf, his tender care over us, rouze up our ſouls to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Gods will, and reſpect of his children, and take courage
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170506:87"/>to rely upon God in the midſt of dangers that compaſs us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; who would not fear thee, O Lord, our God, glorious in Majeſty, dreadful in Holineſs, wonderful in Power! Thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels excel in ſtrength, are cloathed with glory, that man cannot behold; but all their might and goodneſs is derived from thee, a drop of thy Ocean, a beam of thy Sun; if the glory of the creature bee ſo great, the glory of the Creator muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſs all comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Oh how blockiſh am I, that in the view and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the work, have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged my heart to laud and magnifie the work-man?</p>
            <p>Ariſe my ſoul, and gird thy ſelf to the chearful, ſincere, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience to Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. To do the will of God
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170506:88"/>is Angelical preferment, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly exerciſe, the greateſt freedome and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Make haſte, delay not to exerciſe his good pleaſure. Loe the Angels in Heaven are thy ſamplers, whom thou oughteſt to follow. Let not that ſeem irkſome to thee, that is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them: eſteem it not a burden, which is to them an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſolace, and refreſhing. Ah wretched man! why ſhould I grudge to yield obedience to my heavenly Father, or do his will negligently by the halves, when thoſe Noble ſpirits, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſouldiers do alwaies ſtand in readineſs, to receive his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and execute their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? Doth the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the poor Saints of God for their outward baſeneſs; yet I will honour them as the onely excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170506:88"/>for God is their Father, the Angels their Attendants. Wee cap, and bow to them that are nobly attended, gorgeouſly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed, honourably ſerved, but herein the Saints excel, if the thing bee well conſidered. They are eſteemed the ſcum of the world, but reſpected of God in ſuch manner that hee hath given his Angels charge over them; the guard that attends upon his Throne is aſſigned to watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. Walk on couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, O my ſoul, walk on coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly in the waies of piety. Fear not the aſſaults of Satan, the fury of any adverſe power that ſhall oppoſe it ſelf; for more are with thee, than can be againſt thee. If Satan with his bands endeavour thy deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, The troops of heavenly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do watch for thy defence,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170506:89"/>yea, the Lord himſelf is thy keeper, and ſtands at thy right hand to ſave thee from all them that riſe up againſt thee. How great is the clemency, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care of the Lord over his poor people? what tongue can expreſs, what heart comprehend his infinite goodneſs? hee ſends from on high his mighty ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to encamp about us, watch over us, preſerve, and ſave us, from them that lye in wait to vex, and annoy. Oh my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what can I render unto thee for this thy great kindneſs, and unſpeakable mercy? I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give but my heart, which here I offer unto thee; and becauſe I am weak, expoſed to the temptations of Satan, and allurements of this wicked world, I pray thee give mee thy grace, confirm, and ſtrengthen
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170506:89"/>mee, that I may imitate thoſe pure ſpirits every day more and more, that I may praiſe thy Name, execute thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, love thy Children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the converſion of them that go aſtray, and fight thy battels againſt ſin and Satan.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Let man bee the third example; how must wee proceed to meditate on that Subject?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our judgement, wee muſt conſider theſe particulars; the Author, the Matter, Form, End Properties, and Effects, what are like, and what oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. Man is inferiour to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but of earthly creatures moſt excellent.</p>
            <p>The Author of this principal work is God himſelf, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and that in ſpecial manner; for other
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170506:90"/>creatures were made by a ſimple command; man not without a divine conſultation;
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> others at once; man hee did firſt form, then inſpire: others in ſeveral ſhapes like to none other but themſelves; man after his own Image: others with qualities fit for ſervice; man for Dominion: Hee was made the laſt of the creatures, and brought as the Lords Vicegerent into this world, as into a parlour ready trimmed and prepared, for ſo worthy a gueſt.</p>
            <p>Man conſiſteth of two parts, Matter, and Form; Heaven and Earth, a humane body, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſoul; and well may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a little abridgement, map, or table of the whole world. In his ſoul is the nature of Angels, though not ſo active and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. In his body are the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170506:90"/>Meteors, Minerals, as may appear both by vapours, fumes and ſpirits: Hee lives the life of plants, hee hath the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of beaſts, and above all, the addition of reaſon. His body was framed of the duſt of the ground, in more exquiſite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than any other, furniſhed with moſt excellent inſtruments, abſolutely compoſed, both for beauty, and duty, in all the works of holineſs, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For variety of parts, ſweetly knit together, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly diſpoſed, it was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for temperature, exact; for form, erect and ſtreight. In the whole, beautiful, glorious, ſtrong, ſubject to no annoyance, moſt artificially faſhioned, that it might bee the neat, ſtately Palace of a Divine, Noble, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul. In every part
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170506:91"/>beauty, ſtrength, convenience meet together. The diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of every member with its temper, proportion, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, figure, and uſe might well aſtoniſh: The ſoul of man was immediately created of nothing, and being indued with moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent faculties and gifts natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſupernatural, was infuſed into the body, and inſeparably knit (had not ſin made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural divorce) to give life, motion, and ſenſe unto it: Thus man was made the wonder of the world, the principalleſt of living creatures, indued with a reaſonable ſoul, moſt divinely qualified, and ſtrictly united to that earthly maſs to quicken and inliven it.</p>
            <p>The end why man was made in reſpect of God, was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his power, goodneſs and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170506:91"/>wiſdome, appearing in the work it ſelf; of his juſtice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding man if obedient, and in puniſhing man if diſobedient; of his grace and mercy redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him fallen into the gulf of miſery, and that man ſhould praiſe and magnifie his glorious name. In reſpect of man, that hee ſhould live bleſſedly for ever if hee did obey: man by creation was immortal, for death is an enemy, no conſequent of nature, but a companion of ſin; man dieth not becauſe his body was framed of the duſt,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.26.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is infected with ſin: Subjection to mortality, and all miſeries accompanying it, is a fruit of diſobedience.</p>
            <p>Hee is reaſonable and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, able to think, invent, judge, deviſe, compoſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, remember, chuſe, refuſe,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170506:92"/>ſuſpend, and affect. Theſe powers being eſſential to mans nature do ſtill remain, but very weak, and corrupt ſince the fall. Alſo to man is given power to eat, drink, ſleep, weep, laugh, and ſpeak, whereby hee may communicate to others whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hee conceiveth: hee was perfectly conformable to the will of God, made after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, in knowledge, righteouſneſs, and true holineſs: But the Image of God is defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſin, there remaining onely ſome reliques in us, as the ruines of a magnificent and ſtately palace, that ſerved to ſhew what once wee had. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in the ſtate of innocency, man was honoured with great Royalties and Prerogatives, for hee had liberty to eat of every tree in the Garden, except the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170506:92"/>tree of knowledge of good and evil; and was made ruler over all earthly creatures, that hee might freely uſe them to the glory of God, his own neceſſity, and lawful pleaſure: But theſe priviledges hee hath forfeited by rebellion againſt his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>The effects of man are ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the faculties, and gifts hee hath received, as to know God, call upon his name, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him ſincerely, preach the Word, adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, govern, give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, contemplate the works of God, read, write, confer, and diſpute, exerciſe the works of virtue, and honeſty, govern the affections, reverence ſuperiors, live peaceably, and ſuch like. But in all theſe things wee have much diſ-inabled our ſelves
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170506:93"/>by wilful diſobedience.</p>
            <p>Would you ſee the prime dignity of man by compariſon? In ſoul hee is like the Angels, inviſible, immaterial, immortal, beautified with underſtanding, will and power, inriched with admirable, divine gifts, whereby hee reſembleth God, or carrieth his Image. In body hee is the perfection of all earthly things whom they are to ſerve. In both hee is the Epitome of all created excellency in Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How muſt theſe things bee applied unto the heart for the quickening of affection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt ſtir up our ſelves to magnifie the goodneſs of the Lord towards man-kind, to ſhame our ſelves in conſcience of our ſins and miſery: raiſe up the heart to the contempt of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170506:93"/>earthly things, and love of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſeek unto God to have his Image repaired in us again, through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>what is man that thou viſiteſt him, the ſon of man that thou ſo regardeſt him. Thou haſt made him little inferiour to the Angels,</hi> adorned him with grace, ſtamped upon him thy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, inveſted him with digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>and crowned him with glory and honour. Thou haſt given him Dominion over the work of thy hands, and put all things in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection under his feet:</hi> Thou haſt made him for thy ſervice, his ſoul to bee thy habitation, his body to bee the Temple of thy ſpirit, and all other things to bee ſerviceable unto him, the world, and all that is therein for his uſe. All things are prepared for him; all things are ſubject to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170506:94"/>him, hee ruleth over all living creatures, they labour for him, obey his command. Lord thou art the glory of man, man the receptacle of thy works, thy wiſdome, and power: But as mine excellency by creation exceeds, ſo doth my ſhame and miſery by ſin and diſobedience: The higher mine advancement, the lower my fall. This was my chief honour and title, that I was the Image of God; This is my diſgrace and ignominy that I bear the Image of the Devil: This is my comfort, that God did love, delight, and deſire to dwell in mee, it is my miſery that I am caſt out of thy favour, and lye under wrath: Ah what grief is this to think, how my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is altered, through my fooliſhneſs? once immortal, now mortal; once pure, now impure
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170506:94"/>and polluted; once rich in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and grace, now blinde, and naked; once the Image and free ſervant of God, now the vaſſal of Satan; once at peace with God, my conſcience, all creatures, now at war with his Majeſty, my ſelf, all the world: Once a free man to walk at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, now a bondſlave that can doe nothing but ſin; once the Ruler of all creatures, now of all creatures the baſeſt (Satan excepted) once ſubject to no annoyance, now ſecure from nothing that might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. If a Noble man fall from height of honour, to great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and bitter extremities, hee is much afflicted: much greater cauſe have I to bemoan my folly, who have caſt my ſelf headlong from Heaven unto Earth, even to the gulf of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170506:95"/>and confuſion. Oh my ſoul, why doſt thou forget thy ſelf, ſo much as to affect the baſe things of this life? It is a ſhame for him that was to ſubdue all things, to ſuffer himſelf to bee ſubdued by men, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Lacquey to his vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, doing honour to the three great Idols of the world, profit, pleaſure, and preferment. The world is too vile for thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, thou art created for more divine ſervice, the Lord himſelf covets thy love.</p>
            <p>The glory of the world is put under thy feet, as things to bee trodden upon, that which thou ſhouldeſt affect is far above, heavenly and glorious. If the faſhion of the body ſhould bee ſo changed, that the face and eyes bowed to the earth continually, ſhould never bee able to look
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170506:95"/>up, it would bee grievous: But if the ſoul which ſhould bee lifted up to God, do creep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, bee glued to worldly, vain delights, the alteration is more uncomfortable and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous. Hee that ſubdueth the world, doth yeeld himſelf to the ſervice of God, which is perfect liberty; But when wee become ſlaves to the world, wee labour to make God ſervant to our luſts, which is moſt abominable, and accurſed. The glutton makes God his caterer, his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his God, and himſelf the gueſt; The covetous worldling would have God his Broker, and himſelf the Uſurer; The angry ſinner would have God his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, and himſelf the Judge; The ambitious inquiſitor can ſometimes make God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion his ſtile, but honour ſhall
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170506:96"/>bee his God, and luſt reign. The Lord himſelf is abaſed in our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. Love the Lord, Oh my ſoul, and give thy ſelf to the obedience of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thou art the perfection and end of all creatures, the Lord thy life, perfection, comfort: what thou art, is of him, that thou ſhalt bee happy, is of his goodneſs; thou oweſt him thy ſelf, thou waſt created for his glory; defile not his Image, pollute not his workmanſhip, bee not unthankful for what thou haſt received, forget not thy own eſtate. O heavenly Father, I heartily deſire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee whitherſoever thou ſhalt lead mee, to do what thou ſhalt command, and to cleave unto thee as long as I live: But I finde the fleſh rebellious, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting daily, yea, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170506:96"/>haling to thoſe things that are evil: Ah miſerable wretch that I am, who ſhall deliver mee from this body of death? Thou, Thou Lord onely art able, and willing to vouchſafe help, and ſuccour: To thee therefore do I flye, I pray thee have mercy upon mee in Jeſus Chriſt, and repair the loſt image of thy ſelf. Thy hands have made mee, and faſhioned mee, give mee underſtanding, and I ſhall live; thou createdſt mee pure, thou canſt reſtore mee, though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. Create in mee a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within mee: Breathe into mee the Spirit of Life, and eſtabliſh mee in the way of thy Precepts; Heal my ſoul, for I am defiled, and cauſe mee to grow up unto the perfect ſtature of a ſpiritual man. I have wounded my ſoul,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170506:97"/>but cannot cure it, defaced thy Image, but cannot faſhion it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new: Look upon my miſery, dear Father, forgive my ſin, and make mee a new creature for thy infinite mercy, begin in mee this good work, and perfect it to thy praiſe; in thee do I truſt, to thee I ſeek for grace, for in thee the fatherleſs finde mercy.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>I would know in the fourth place, how wee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to meditate on Gods infinite greatneſs?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God is infinitely good, without quality, infinitely great, without quantity, his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is incomprehenſible, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth what wee can ſpeak or think.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt ſtir up our ſelves to magnifie the Lord, love, fear, reverence, and truſt in him for ever. <hi>Great is the Lord, and worthy to bee praiſed: for hee ſitteth upon the circuit of the earth, and ſtretcheth out the Heavens like a curtain: He bringeth the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth to nothing, and lifteth up the meek to honour: Great is our Lord, and of great power, his understanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</hi> The men of this world la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſet forth the ſtate, and magnificence of earthly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, the largeneſs of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, greatneſs of their power, continuance of their

Oh my ſoul, why art thou ſo ſilent, awake, and ſing aloud of the praiſes of God, whoſe greatneſs is infinite, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, incomprehenſible, thou canſt not by ſearching finde him out: but remember to magnifie his work, which men behold. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man may ſee it. Man may behold it afar off; Love the Lord, Oh my ſoul, and ſtick faſt unto him as thy life and treaſure. Hee is that infinite, unbounded, eternal goodneſs, paſſing all humane both ſearch, and ſight, that filleth and includeth all things.

Oh that true love, like a ſtrong ſtream, which the further it is from this

In Gods love there is no mixture of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; no want of delight, fulneſs of pleaſure, all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Alas! alas that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many cold winds of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould blow betwixt God and our hearts, to make our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections cooler unto him. What dull metal is this wee are made of? wee have the fountain of felicity and eternity, and yet complain of want and wearineſs. Do wee freeze in the fire, and ſtarve at a feaſt?

Let mee have my God, and let mee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want him, ſo ſhall my joyes bee laſting, pure, incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: for poſſeſſing him that is the pure, eternal, and an all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient good, how ſhould I not

Oh my ſoul, fear the Lord, and ſtand in awe of his Majeſty, for hee is a great God, and terrible, a King above all Gods. At his preſence the earth trembleth, the mountains quake, and the foundations of the world are ſhaken: The Angels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not behold his glory, the Sun and Moon are not clean in his ſight. Fear the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity; harbour no wicked plot in thy breaſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive not evil in thy thoughts: for thou haſt to deal with a God that is light of hearing, who dwelleth in thy heart, and knoweth thy Imaginations long before: And what needs any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence when the Judge is witneſs?

Hee is the everlaſting Rock, conſtant in promiſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſent for our aid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in love and favour.

            <p>Queſt. <hi>I would now hear how wee must proceed to meditate on the Love of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt conſider of the efficient cauſe, ſubject, end, objects, effects, properties, and kinds of this Love; what is like, what oppoſite unto it.</p>
            <p>The Love of God ſignifieth either that love whereby God loveth us,
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.48. 1 Joh. 3.17 1 Joh. 2.15</note> or that affection whereby wee being united unto God, do reſt in him with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight: Of this Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical virtue firſt, in order, not the firſt, in fruit, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the greateſt, the end of the Commandement, the bond of perfection, the fulfilling of the Law, I purpoſe to meditate by the grace of God. This Love is a grace ſupernatural, and is neither in us by nature,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170506:103"/>nor can bee acquired by our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour. Yea, the meaſure of love is not defined according to the endeavour of the received, but the pleaſure and will of the Spirit meaſuring and pouring it into every one.</p>
            <p>The author, or principal cauſe of Divine Love, is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by his bleſſed Spirit renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and regenerating our hearts to the love of his Majeſty. <hi>Love is the fruit of the Spirit</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5.22</note>.
<note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 4.7 Eph. 6.23.</note> 
               <hi>He that loveth is born of God. Love is of God, and God is love:</hi> Hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us in his well-beloved, and is the ever-ſpringing fountain of all love in us. The Spirit open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our eyes to ſee and behold the incomprehenſible goodneſs of God, without which there is no love: For of a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known there is no deſire. The ſame Spirit infuſeth the grace of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170506:103"/>love, whereby wee are enabled to love God, and quickened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it;
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.5</note> whereas of our ſelves we are deſtitute of all power and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to every ſpiritual duty. And the <hi>Spirit ſheddeth abroad the love of God in our hearts,</hi> whereby they are warmed to love God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: The means which the Spirit uſeth for this purpoſe, is the Word of Grace revealing the incomparable love of God in Jeſus Chriſt towards us moſt miſerable wretches.</p>
            <p>The leſs principal cauſe of love is man renewed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.7 Deut. 30.6</note> Man regenerate doth love the Lord, not of himſelf, but by the grace of God: <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul.</hi> Faith well rooted, will
<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5.6 <hi>Quantum cognoſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum diligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
               </note> animate, quicken, and move love. Faith
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170506:104"/>and Love are both graces ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, infuſed at once in the ſame inſtant of time; but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of working, Faith hath the precedency, and kindleth Love.</p>
            <p>From this it followeth, that the ſubject of Love is a renewed heart, inlightened with the true ſaving knowledge of God, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, and ſeaſoned by Grace. For Love is a ſpiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the reaſonable part, preſuppoſing knowledge, and affiance, whereby the ſoul go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth to imbrace the good it apprehendeth.</p>
            <p>The end of Love is the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of God as the chief good. Love (as wee ſee) makes man and woman one, and ſo it doth couple us to God. It is a weight whereby the heart is inclined toward God, and wholly carried unto him.</p>
            <pb n="189" facs="tcp:170506:104"/>
            <p>The object of Charity, is God in Chriſt; God is to bee loved, not only as hee is good, merciful, gracious, long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bountiful; and as hee doth love, and daily lade us with his bleſſings: But alſo as hee is wiſe, juſt, and powerful, even as hee doth chaſtize and viſit us with ſevere corrections: For as the true love of children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Parents doth effect this, that they love their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and perſwade themſelves that they bee beloved of them, though they bee reprehended, croſſed, corrected, and cannot obtain what they will; ſo true Love doth look to God when hee ſendeth perſecution, war, ſickneſs, or any other calamity. God is to bee loved in Chriſt, in whom hee is well pleaſed, greatly delighted in us: If any
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170506:105"/>man love not the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, let him bee accurſed. Chriſt hath redeemed us unto God, and reconciled us being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Hee is ordained of God to be our Lord and King, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced at the right hand of his Father, to give ſalvation unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Love is a ſupernatural gift or Grace, whereby wee
<note n="*" place="margin">Pſa. 63.8 Joſh. 22.5. Deut. 4.4</note> cleave to God in Chriſt, and deſire to poſſeſs him with joy, and comfort.</p>
            <p>The acts, or effects of Love, preſuppoſed, or comprehended under it, are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To acknowledge God to bee the chief good, and with moſt earneſt deſire to bee carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards him, that wee might bee united to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To reſt, delight, and rejoyce in him, and to deſire nothing above him, nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To ſeek the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his glory, and to think, will, ſpeak, or do, what is acceptable in his ſight, whether wee have to deal immediately with his Majeſty, or others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to him: Hee that loves God, will love what the Lord loveth, and hate what hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, do what hee commandeth, and forgo whatſoever is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; <hi>Whoſe keepeth the Word,</hi>

               <hi>in him verily is the love of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> To neglect no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which are or may bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the exerciſe of piety: Love is diligent, and laborious.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> To love them that fear God, for his ſake, and to draw as many as poſſibly they can, to the knowledge, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170506:106"/>of the truth: If wee love one another,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.12</note> God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</p>
            <p>The Properties of Love are,</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It cannot bee loſt; the act of Love may bee intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the grace cannot bee loſt; for the gifts of God are without repentance; the life of grace is everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is imperfect in this life, and ever wanting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that may bee added to it; for as long as wee live here, it is far ſhort in degree to that the Law requireth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It is ſincere and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire for nature, though for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree defective. True love is not maimed in parts, though it bee not come to full growth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It increaſeth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in this life, and ſhall bee perfected in Heaven: When
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170506:106"/>Faith ſhall ceaſe, then Love ſhall come to full ſtrength, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Not that the Saints can love God in meaſure anſwerable to his goodneſs, and excellency: for a finite virtue cannot infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love the infinite God, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Beloved; but their love ſhall bee preſerved ſo far as a creature is capable.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It is moſt pure and comfortable, free from all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſorrow and vexation: Men, though never ſo loving, are compaſſed with infirmities, ſubject to paſſions, and many things may befall them; they may do ſomewhat that is to us occaſion of grief, and pain: but in the Lord, each Chriſtian heart ſhall ever finde matter of ſolace and refreſhing, never of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſcomfort, if the fault bee not in himſelf. Oh the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170506:107"/>of Love, what is it but the gate of Heaven, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of everlaſting happineſs, not the leaſt portion of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inheritance which wee ſhall then fully poſſeſs, when love is grown to perfect ripeneſs!</p>
            <p>The degrees and kinds of love are diverſe. Wee love God for good things received, or benefits paſt; wee love him alſo for the good wee expect, that is eternal happineſs, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life; and wee love him for himſelf, and for his own glory. God is to bee loved for himſelf, and not for another end, form, or efficient; for hee is the laſt end of all things, his eſſence is perfect goodneſs, his goodneſs is from himſelf, and not from an external efficient: but nothing hinders why God ſhould not bee loved for his bleſſings received, or hoped for.</p>
            <pb n="197" facs="tcp:170506:107"/>
            <p>Each grace of the Spirit is for original divine, in nature excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, for uſe neceſſary, bending towards Heaven: but if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon bee made, love muſt have the preheminence for uſe and continuance. The dignity and ſweetneſs of love will appear by the baſeneſs of what is oppoſite: That is beſt whoſe contrary is the worſt: Now what is more abominable, hateful, pernicious, ſo full of vexation, and horrour, as the love of ſin, love of the world, and hatred of God? As continual fear, unquietneſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, doth accompany theſe with eternal confuſion in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end: So unſpeakable joy, peace, contentment, ſecurity do wait upon it; and the end ſhall bee everlaſting glory, and full fruition of God, in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How muſt theſe things
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170506:108"/>bee applied to the heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt ſtir up our hearts, to the hearty, intire love of God, by examination, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhame to our ſelves for our manifold ſlips, and great ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, complaining of our great bondage, and inability to raiſe up our ſouls, hearts, wiſhing and longing to bee fired with the love of God, calling upon our ſelves to bee more hot, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and ſeeking unto the Lord, by earneſt, and hearty prayer.</p>
            <p>Love the Lord, Oh my ſoul, and all that is within thee, love him with all thy ſtrength, and let his glory bee dear unto thee, for hee is the object of love, gracious,
<note place="margin">Affectus amoris pro objecto ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum &amp; bonum.</note> merciful, long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, abundant in goodneſs, and truth: hee is thy Father, thy God, thy Husband, thou art bound unto him by covenant;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170506:108"/>his love to thee is free, and of meer grace; thy love to him is debt, many waies due from thee, deſerved by him: Hee loves thee for thy profit, thou art to love him for thy own good, for in his love ſtands thy perfection: Hee is the chief good, abſolute, all-ſufficient, the reſt, and ſtay of the mind, beyond which it can deſire nothing, in whom it findes incredible joy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and ſhall poſſeſs everlaſting conſolation, when it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately united to him by viſion, and love. The former bleſſings thou haſt received, the future good things thou doſt expect, and look for, do challenge this duty at thy hand. Publicans and ſinners love thoſe that love them, and for kindneſs return affection: God hath loved thee firſt, loved thee when thou waſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170506:109"/>not, when thou waſt miſerable: Hee hath laden thee with his benefits, given thee more than thou wouldeſt deſire, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented thee with favours which thou never didſt ask; hee made thee of nothing, hee is thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, redeemer, Saviour, who hath delivered thee from death, and hell, and vouchſafeth unto thee, life and mercy; his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon thee are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, paſs all thought and reckoning. What canſt thou render leſs than hearty affection for theſe ineſtimable favours? Oh my ſoul, thou canſt not love thy ſelf truly, if thou love not him above all things, for thou art coupled to him by love, in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy, without whom to bee, is to bee moſt miſerable. Thou canſt not but deſire happineſs, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170506:109"/>thou canſt not bee without love. But ah wretch that I am, I finde mine affection is weak toward God, ſtrong to vanity. Thoſe wee love, do wee not love to bee preſent with them? If they bee abſent, do wee not think long till they return again? Are wee not grieved to hear them wronged by word or deed, whom wee eſteem dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of? are wee not deſirous to give them content? doth it not cut us if wee do them any harm? Are wee not with them in thought, though abſent in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? glad of a letter that comes from them? is not the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger welcome that can bring us tidings of their welfare? But I finde little joy in coming pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly or privately into Gods houſe, or preſence. I think little of him, and that but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170506:110"/>I ſpeak little to him, and that not without wearineſs and diſtraction. Nay, I am like thoſe children, who can play abroad all the day long, and never care to look unto their Parents: When did my heart long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, and to bee with Chriſt? Though God through ſundry troubles do even ſmoak mee out of this world, yet I will not come away in mine affection. When I ſee Gods name blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and all wickedneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, do mine eyes guſh out with tears? or do not I offend daily, and paſs it over, taking too light penance of my ſelf? It is irkſome to mee to do his will; I do not long for his preſence, nor bewail his abſence; I do not ſtudy to pleaſe him in all things, nor can I rejoyce in the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Saints: when I my
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170506:110"/>ſelf am in miſery and diſtreſs, I cannot prize his favour, am not cheared with his promiſes, do not delight in his ſtatutes above all things: His Word is his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent unto mee, but I am not glad and diligent with care and conſcience to read it; vanity hath ſtollen away my heart, and the tranſitory bewitching pleaſures of the world (which cannot profit) have taken up my thoughts. This hath been mine impudent behaviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee my God, which I cannot with any words of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſufficiently diſcover.</p>
            <p>If a woman ſhould bee dead in the neſt, when her husband were before her, but ſhould bee affectionate to every ſtranger; if ſhee ſhould not care how long ſhee were abſent from him, but think her ſelf beſt while they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170506:111"/>were aſunder; if ſhee cared little how her loving husband were offended, caſting that at her heels, which hee takes to heart, were not this ſhameleſs beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in her? And ſhall I not bee aſhamed to ſhew no more love to thee, to whom my ſoul is married in Chriſt? Oh my ſoul! what canſt thou finde in the world, why thou doſt affect it? it hath bred much vexation and ſorrow, thou haſt been croſſed and moleſted with it, the more thou loveſt it, the greater trouble &amp; diſcontentment thou findeſt therein, and wilt thou ſtill take pleaſure in thy pain? what canſt thou not finde in God, and that above all thought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, why thou ſhouldeſt intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleave unto him? what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion couldeſt thou finde at any time to draw thy affection from
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170506:111"/>him? wilt thou leave the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and marrow that is in the houſe of God, to feed upon the refuſe, and ſcraps that this world affords? Ah wretch that I am! who ſhall deliver mee from this bondage of ſin? I am full of uncharitable and falſe love. I can love my ſelf, I have affection enough to the things of this world, to the gifts of God, and thoſe the meaneſt, more than to the giver; as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots to rings, gold, bracelets, more than to the ſender. But I have not power to raiſe my ſoul to the love of God in Chriſt, here my affections lye dead, and will not mount aloft. Oh that the love of God did poſſeſs my reins in ſuch ſort, that in thought I might bee ſtill with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his preſence, and walk before him in dutiful obedience!
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170506:112"/>Oh that my heart did burn with love that is ſtrong as death, hot as coals of Juniper, that hath a vehement flame that no waters can quench, no floods can drown, no allurements can draw aſide. Why art thou ſo dead, Oh my ſoul? why doſt thou not lift up thy ſelf to the love of God? whom haſt thou in Heaven but him? and who in earth is to bee deſired in compariſon of him? for whom doſt thou reſerve thy prime affection? for the world, ſin, vanity? Oh adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, knoweſt thou not that the amity of the world is enmity with God? thou haſt gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, and deeply defiled thy ſelf with the love of ſin, return now unto the Lord, and embrace him with moſt intire and dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: what thou haſt beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the world, pleaſure,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170506:112"/>luſts, carnal delights, to thy great diſcomfort, now ſet it wholly upon things above, that it may finde reſt and comfort. Oh Lord, I beſeech thee, who art only able to purge my heart of all filthy, prophane love, and to fill it with the pure love of thy holy Majeſty, this is thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I will circumciſe your hearts, and make you love mee with all your hearts; therefore I am bold to make this prayer, and will confidently wait upon thee for this mercy.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhould a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to meditate on the Fall of our first Parents?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hee muſt conſider the ſubject, cauſes, and end of that act, aimed at, but not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; the degrees, properties, and effects of it.</p>
            <p>By the Fall of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170506:113"/>wee underſtand the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they tranſgreſſed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, in eating the forbidden fruit: this is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo called, becauſe, as an heavy body falling upon ſome hard and ſharp rock is greatly brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and hurt: ſo man, after hee had received ſo many, and great gifts from God, ſinning wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt his expreſs charge and commandement, did grievouſly wound himſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of this tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was our firſt Parents <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> made after the Image of God, perfect in ſtature of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſtrength of mind, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with excellent preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of liberty and dominion, planted in a garden of delights, that they might dreſs it, and keep it, favoured of God, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170506:113"/>admitted into near fellowſhip with him.</p>
            <p>The principal outward cauſe of mans diſobedience, was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the Prince of darkneſs, that old murtherer, who being fallen from God, and ſhut up under condemnation, did with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible fury, and malice, ſeek the diſhonour of God, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of mankind: This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious one ſpying his opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſet upon the woman, as the fitter to be made his prey, when ſhee was alone; and by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty beguiled her; The Serpent, the moſt ſubtil of beaſts which the Lord had made, was the inſtrument that hee uſed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the woman; and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man her ſelf being firſt in the tranſgreſſion, was made the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling inſtrument of her husbands deſtruction. The quality of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170506:114"/>fruit as it was good for meat, and pleaſant to the eye, was by accident a cauſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to eat, which yet they might, and ought to have forborn, having liberty to eat of all the trees in the garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and being ſtrictly charged upon pain of death not to taſte of it. The juſt, and good Law of God was a blameleſs occaſion of mans ſin, as it did forbid an act in it ſelf indifferent, that it could not bee done without ſin. The Law and Sin, as well as the Law and Obedience, work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though in a diſtinct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for of Obedience the Law is a principal cauſe, but of ſin an accidental, as working beſides his own ſcope, and main drift, which is to ſavour nothing but life, and alſo as a contrary to ſin. The Lord in his wiſe providence
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170506:114"/>did work in the fall of man, as the Law by accident was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, but hee is not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his ſin, hee did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him to offend, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from him any grace, that by Covenant, or otherwiſe hee was bound to give him.</p>
            <p>The principal inward cauſe of this tranſgreſſion, was the will of man, freely turning from the Commandement of God, which hee might and ought to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, but would not; and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly hearkening to the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of Satan, which hee ſhould have reſiſted, but did not. The ſin of man was the eating of the forbidden fruit, not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conſidered in it ſelf, but in reſpect of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and charge whereby God had ſeverely forbidden the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the fruit of that tree,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170506:115"/>and had threatned puniſhment to them that ſhould tranſgreſs.</p>
            <p>In evil actions no end can properly bee aſſigned, for the end is of a good thing, and to be deſired. But Satan in that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation aimed at the diſhonour of God, and the damnation of Man. Man being deceived by the old Serpent, propoſed this end to himſelf, but obtained it not; that hee might ſatisfie his ſuperiour affection to the Image of God, and his inferiour to the fruit of the tree. The Lord, who bringeth light out of darkneſs, out of his infinite wiſdome did order this evil to the ſetting forth of his mercy, and juſtice, and the utter confuſion of Satan, contrary to his purpoſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment.</p>
            <p>In this their diſobedience wee may obſerve theſe degrees: The
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170506:115"/>impreſſion of the ſuggeſtion; obſcuration of their thoughts concerning the excellency of God; forgetfulneſs of what was done before, and what God commanded; doubting of the truth of God; tickling of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the woman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected great power, dignity; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the flatteries, and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Satan, and familiarity with him, and inclination of will to the forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This was the firſt ſin committed by man, in it ſelf moſt hainous: the fountain of all other evils, both of ſin and puniſhment. Many things do ſhew the greatneſs of this ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It was the tranſgreſſion of that precept which God had given for the trial of mans obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſo was an abſolute denial of ſubjection, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170506:116"/>of obedience: As the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it had been an open profeſſion of ſubmiſſion and due obedience. It was not a breach of ſome particular Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an univerſal denial of all the branches of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It was intollerable, that man being inriched with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graces, priviledges, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſhould preſently forget God, being ſo much indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bound unto him in love for his ineſtimable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Amongſt ſo many trees in the Garden, it was eaſie for man to forbear the purſute of one; and being made after the Image of God, hee might have reſiſted the temptation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: Wherefore to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bee drawn away in that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170506:116"/>manner was an hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p n="4">4 This ſin was committed in Paradiſe, where the tree of life ſtood in their ſight, and God had manifeſted himſelf unto them familiarly. In reſpect of God, the Law, the Offender; this ſin was hateful, and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This ſin was not the proper ſin of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but the common ſin of all their poſterity, who were in their loins when they did offend, and afterwards by natural propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation deſcended from them: for they did repreſent all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which was propagated from them as the root.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The effects of this ſin ſtayed not in the firſt authors of it, but ſpread, and ſtretched themſelves over all mankind:
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170506:117"/>For if they whoſe Parents are infected with any diſeaſe, their children do poſſeſs it by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; how is it poſſible that our firſt Parents, being deprived of the Image of God, wee their poſterity ſhould ſpring of them perfect, and without maim? For the beginnings of all things are all that in power which doth ſpring from thoſe beginnings, for the virtue that is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, is communicated to the things which receive beginning from them: Like egg, like bird; what is in the root will bee in the branches, and the vice or fault that is in the beginning, is common to the thing begun. The puniſhment of this ſin doth degenerate into ſin, As the want of holineſs, and proneneſs to evil, is not only a judgement inflicted for ſin, but it is ſin, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170506:117"/>the cauſe of ſin; One ſin begets another, and the ſecond is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the former, both proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and accidentally.</p>
            <p>The effects of this firſt ſin are bitterneſs it ſelf, to wit, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of mankind in general, wrath, blame, guilt, depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Image corruption of nature, ſpiritual bondage, ſubjection to death temporal, and eternal. God is offended in that his Commandement is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed to the derogation of his ſoveraignty; ſin is vile, and naught, deſerving blame; man is guilty, and tied to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whence iſſueth griping of conſcience, fear of the angry Judge, and dread of puniſhment. The loſs of original Juſtice fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the act of ſin, in whoſe room ſucceeded corruption of the whole man, in every power,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170506:118"/>and faculty. Thus the liberty of man was turned into miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſervitude, and hee became bondſlave to ſin-revenging ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as his principal Lord; to the Devil, and his Angels, and to the power of his accuſing and condemning conſcience, as the Lords Miniſters. Moreover, the natural man hath no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al liberty, to do any thing ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good, as hee did before ſin entred, but is led as a ſlave, by luſts, by paſſions, by objects, which pleaſe him: So that hee is in a brutiſh bondage. <hi>And death entred into the world by ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5.12</note> 
               <hi>and is gone over all men, for as much as all men have ſinned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In reſpect of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> the effects are common to both, or particular to either.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The common are ſenſe of nakedneſs, ſhame, fear of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170506:118"/>angry Judge, ſlight, and deſire to hide themſelves from the preſence of the Lord, ejection out of Paradiſe into the curſed Earth, and ſtopping the way that they might not enter to eat of the tree of life.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The particular effects in reſpect of <hi>Adam,</hi> are, that the Earth is accurſed to bring forth briars, and thorns; that he ſhould till the ground in labour, and eat his bread in the ſweat of his brows, till hee return unto the duſt.</p>
            <p>The woman was ſentenced to conceive and bring forth in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and to bee in painful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to her husband.</p>
            <p>Satan intended the diſhonour of God, and deſtruction of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by that temptation: but it turned to his confuſion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow. The ſeed of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170506:119"/>woman hath bruiſed the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head; his power is cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his devices fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Nor did the inſtrument of the Devil eſcape unpuniſhed: the Serpent is accurſed above all the beaſts of the earth, moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſhamed to appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; hee is adjudged to creep upon his belly with pain, to eat the duſt for meat; a grievous diet. And the Lord hath put enmity betwixt him, and the woman.</p>
            <p>All ſin, eſpecially prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and contempt of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is like to this of our firſt Parents in ſome ſort, but this was the firſt ſin, the fountain of all ſin, the ſin of man and his poſterity: for <hi>Adam</hi> received, and loſt integrity both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and us.</p>
            <pb n="221" facs="tcp:170506:119"/>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are theſe things to bee applied unto the heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt work our heart to humiliation, ſtir up our ſelves earneſtly to ſeek help and deliverance, and acknowledge the juſtice of God in correcting, and his incomprehenſible mercy, in vouchſafing means of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto man. How is man fallen from his firſt dignity and good eſtate? hee was created holy, and happy, furniſhed with grace, and ſet in place of high renown. Thou Lord didſt crown him with glory and honour, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him a patent for his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that they ſhould live in bleſſedneſs before thee. But wo is mee! what alteration do I finde? Man hath ſinned, and God is diſpleaſed. Man that was the beauty of the world, the beloved of God, is now the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170506:120"/>map of miſery, the object of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revenging juſtice: His mind is beſotted, his conſcience unquiet, his will and affection poiſoned with ſin, fear, dread, horrour, and trembling poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his reins; his body is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, deformed, ſubject to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of heat, cold, diſtemper many waies. The Free-man of God, the Lord of the creatures, is brought into moſt miſerable, and ſore bondage unto Satan, ſin, his own conſcience; who can comprehend the miſeries of this life, whereunto hee lyes open? No words can deſcribe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual plagues that are ſeized upon the ſoul already, nor the dreadful torments that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him in hell for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore. Oh my ſoul, enter into thy ſelf, conſider, and bewail thy natural eſtate: thou
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170506:120"/>art expoſed to ſuffer a thouſand evils, to weariſome vanity in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, yea through fear of death, the upſhot of evils, thou art in bondage all thy dayes, while in that ſtate thou abideſt. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did never put <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſuch hard ſervice, as the Devil putteth thee to while thou art under his power. Thou art ſick, filthy, naked, crooked, fallen from the love of God, more odious in his eyes than the ſtink, or filthy ſavour of a dead corps in the noſtrils of man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the torments of Hell, ſhut up under the curſe of the Law, abideſt under wrath. How do men of the world take on, when they have loſt a great friend, upon whom all their hopes depended, when they bee caſt from the top of honour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gulf of miſery, poverty,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170506:121"/>and diſgrace? weep, oh my ſoul, and pour out tears in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, for thou haſt loſt thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, art ſpoiled of thy ornaments, and haſt provoked the Lord to anger by thy inventions. The brute beaſts take it as a grievous thing to bee inſnared, and taken, and wilt thou laugh in the midſt of bondage, and count it liberty to bee a ſlave of Satan? Death is terrible, and wilt not thou fear Hell, which followeth after it, as a deſert of thy tranſgreſſion? Ah miſerable man, and the more miſerable, that thou art ſenſeleſs of thy miſery; yet now that I know my diſeaſe, I will ſeek for remedy. The ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will take bitter pills to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver health, the bondman deſires liberty, the captive freedome, the condemned a pardon: My preſent caſe is very wretched,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170506:121"/>and in no caſe to be reſted in. Nature teacheth all creatures to ſhroud themſelves from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or being in diſtreſs to ſeek help without delay, much more am I to bee moved with mine eſtate, who am ſubject to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, which hath already ſeized upon mee in a ſpiritual death of ſoul, and mortality, or dying ſtate of the body; wee will meet a diſeaſe betime, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to rid our ſelves of it; if any thing threaten our name and eſtate, wee will indeavour quickly to free the one, and the other: But whither ſhall I fly for ſuccour? where ſhall I finde the Phyſician that is able to cure, and redeem mee from the tyranny of Satan? Set mee free from the fear of Hell? I am e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at my wits end, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which way to turn. Oh
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170506:122"/>Lord, I am utterly deſtitute of all means to help my ſelf, it is not in my power to ſatisfie thy juſtice, overcome death, or deliver my ſoul out of the hands of the Devil: I cannot think a good thought; I know not, nor of my ſelf can know the way of Life, or means of my recovery. Bleſſed God, as of thine infinite mercy thou haſt ordeined, ſo I pray thee reveal unto mee the way how I may eſcape eternal death deſerved by my ſin, and bee made partaker of everlaſting happineſs, through thy ſpecial grace. Righteous art thou oh Lord, and juſt are thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I know that in very faithfulneſs thou haſt afflicted mee, and that I have deſerved much more than ever I felt from thee; Thou mighteſt have caſt mee for ever out of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170506:122"/>and given mee my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Devil, and his Angels: But loe thou doſt correct mee in meaſure for my good, to purge mee from ſin, and bring mee unto repentance, that I might bee ſaved. Oh my God, I will magnifie thy name, for thou haſt redeemed my ſoul from death, my darling from the power of the doggs. This mercy was not ſhewed to the Angels, Creatures more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than man. Should one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from the ſtate of villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, or ranſome us from the Gallows, wee would think wee could not bee thankful enough; But Lord thou haſt redeemed mee from revenging Juſtice, from the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, holding mee under the curſe, from the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience juſtly condemning mee,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170506:123"/>from the power of ſin command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as King: How great is thy mercy towards mee! I am not able to comprehend it. <hi>As my ſin and miſery hath abounded, thy mercy hath abounded much more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Let us now hear what order is to bee obſerved in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt call to minde, and diſcourſe with our ſelves of the cauſes, ends, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and effects, and kinds of ſin: what is contrary unto it, what like, and what unlike.</p>
            <p>O my ſoul, what is ſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou art beſet and ſtained, yea miſerably beſotted, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam?</hi> what is it but the privation of Gods Image, and corruption of the ſoul, an aberration from the rule of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, an evil diſpoſition of the ſubject, turning aſide from the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170506:123"/>path of life, and ſwarving from the mark and end that all ſhould aim at?</p>
            <p>God is the fountain of all good things, the giver of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and perfect gift; but ſin was not created by him, can receive no approbation from him. God cannot poſſibly ſin; for hee may work beſides his rule who may ſin: But Gods Rule is his moſt juſt and wiſe will, which hee cannot but work after, no more than hee can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his own nature. God cannot bee the author of ſin in and with his creature, as hee is of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good word, and work; for that which the creature doth, God being the author and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal worker of it, hee muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the manner of it by his Commandement, and work it in him by his Spirit: But it is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170506:124"/>impoſſible for the creature to ſin, in working after that which is commanded him of God; God cannot ſo far will ſin, as to approve it for good in it ſelf; it hath no proportion to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is ſuch a thing as hee cannot bee author of in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor yet the creature work while it keepeth communion with him, wherefore God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow it as good in it ſelf. The Lord perſwadeth to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, threatneth the ſinner, commandeth the practice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, puniſheth the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Hee is juſt and holy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in all his waies, and cannot bee tainted with the leaſt ſpot or blemiſh:
<note place="margin">Jam. 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>Thou oh God tempteſt no man, as thou canſt not bee tempted of evil;</hi> and if it bee not of God, it cannot bee good; for hee is the abſolute original
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170506:124"/>goodneſs, from whom cometh every good by participation.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of ſin is ſome vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agent, that worketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Rule, and comes ſhort in goodneſs required: Sin it ſelf is an aberration, the ſubordinate and deficient cauſe of ſin, is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or man himſelf revolted from God; Satan ſoliciteth, the fleſh inticeth, the will conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſo ſin is finiſhed: The Devil was made an Angel of light, but hee abode not in the truth, and being fallen from Heaven, ceaſeth not to draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the ſame perdition. God made man righteous, but hee found out many inventions; this is the cauſe, but what is the end of ſin?</p>
            <p>Of evil there is no end, for that is never good; No gain to bee gotten by that which is
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170506:125"/>naught and vile; the poiſoned ſtalk can bear no wholeſome fruit. Satan in tempting aimeth at mans perdition; Man in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning intendeth the ſatisfaction of his luſts; The Lord doth by his providence order it to the glory of his name; but of ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly there is no end to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: God takes occaſion by ſin to give the promiſe of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour. Hee can uſe ſin for a puniſhment,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.24.</note> for the exerciſing of his children: No ſpeech from <hi>Shimei,</hi> but ſinful, reviling ſpeech was <hi>Davids</hi> exerciſe; but yet the goodneſs that cometh by ſin is not of, nor through it by nature, but from the infinite wiſdome of God, who knoweth how to work good out of evil.</p>
            <p>Let us ſomewhat inquire into the properties of this poiſon: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin is mortal in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170506:125"/>it deſerveth and bringeth death endleſs, and eaſeleſs, of ſoul and body; for it is a turning aſide from God, who is the life of the ſoul; it is a breach of his Law, an offence againſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty. If a man ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Majeſty of an earthly Prince, hee is puniſhed with temporary death, or perpetual impriſonment, if hee could bee ſuppoſed to live alwaies hee ſhould lye in for ever: How much more deſervedly am I ſubject to eternal death, who have ſinned againſt an eternal God? Every ſin in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is accompanied with final impenitency: Hee that ſinneth once, can never ceaſe to ſin by any natural power; ſin is a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning leproſie, that cannot bee ſtayed; the ſoul that is once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, muſt go amiſs for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170506:126"/>ever: (if it bee not rectified by ſupernatural power.) It is of grace that ſin is pardoned, it is of ſupernatural power that any ſoul is ſet free from the power and tyranny of it. For being once enthralled by voluntary ſubmiſſion, wee cannot after draw back and work delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Sin is of a ſoiling nature, and defileth all it toucheth; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good work and holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. To the unclean all things are unclean. The Word, Prayer, Sacraments, Alms, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is polluted by that touch. Corrupt qualities are more apt to hurt, than ſound to heal; one rotten ſheep may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole flock, but cannot bee cured by them. One filthy ragg ſtained with the plague may infect a whole pack; but the clean garment cannot purifie
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170506:126"/>it. If a common garment touch holy fleſh, the garment is not ſanctified, but the fleſh pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The prayer of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. Sin mixed with Gods ordinances, is like poiſon mingled with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meat, that corrupteth it for our uſe and nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Mark and conſider well the effects of ſin, O my ſoul! the waters of this fountain are bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the fruits of this tree unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury. They that ſow iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhall reap vanity; and they that follow vanity, forſake mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Affliction purſueth ſinners, and ſhall overtake them to their coſt: without queſtion the wages of ſin is death. Look as it is with men, if they turn themſelves from this aſpectable light, they are forthwith environed with darkneſs: So man turning away
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170506:127"/>by his ſin from God the Father of lights, from whence every good gift cometh, hee cannot but bee forthwith in outward and inward darkneſs. By reaſon of ſin the ſoul is dead in ignorance, and luſt: So that they have in them a ſeed apt to bring forth every ſin: Our bodies have mortality as a worm corrupting them, our conditions are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a thouſand vanities, and weariſome courſes, and theſe are the beginnings of evil. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, darkneſs, fear, horrour, and ſhame are the companions of ſin; diſgrace, ſickneſs, poverty, loſs of goods, the beſt fruit it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Haſt thou loſt any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? ſin hath robbed thee of it; doſt thou want any good thing? ſin keepeth thee from it; art thou annoyed with evil? thy perdition is of thy ſelf; ſin ſets
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170506:127"/>man at odds with God, the Law, his own conſcience, all creatures, and with himſelf. Oh what a drudge is man made to his luſts by ſin! what confuſion, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bitterneſs, doth lodge in the heart continually! Look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and ſee what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations it hath made. How are the mighty ſlain, and glorious Kingdomes laid on heaps? Is not ſin the cauſe of all diſorders, wars, confuſions, bloodſheds, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, and peſtilences that ever were in the world? The ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of this life are many and grievous, but nothing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſpiritual and eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that ſin bringeth with it. Oh that thou didſt behold how miſerably the ſoul is mangled, defaced, wounded, impriſoned by it; the light of nature, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of conſcience, power of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170506:128"/>grace is not able to ſet forth or comprehend the deſert and fruit of ſin; for the full wrath of God which ſhall bee executed upon the ungodly, exceedeth all that can bee imagined. If the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proſper for a time, ſin turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their bleſſings into curſes: The Table, and by proportion, the wealth, ſtrength, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the wicked are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſnares wherein they are caught to bee deſtroyed. It is miſery to ſail to Hell with the pleaſanteſt wind; and to live in fat paſtures to bee fed unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>This curſed ſin is a monſter of many heads, a ſerpent with many ſtings, the kinds cannot eaſily bee reckoned, the number paſſeth all count. It is original that is born and bred with us, or actual that is brought forth by
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170506:128"/>us: That is the filthy corrupt fountain, this the filthy ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puddle water that runneth from it; that the curſed root, this the bud, and bloſſome of that venemous tree.</p>
            <p>Again, there are ſins of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, omiſſion, and commiſſion; for ſometimes the ſoul worketh for matter that which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but in other manner than God hath preſcribed; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth ſuſpect, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to move after the good commanded, and ſometimes it doth move it ſelf to ſomething which is forbidden, which is the greateſt, and higheſt kinde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. For as in a wife, not to love her husband is a great lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but not only to neglect his love, but to turn to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement of ſtrangers is much more hainous: So for the ſoul
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170506:129"/>not to cleave to God in doing righteouſneſs is ſinful, but to leave him, and turn to love and like any kinde of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this is moſt ſinful.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is either inward, lurking and boiling in the heart, by evil thoughts, motions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, wiſhes, conſent; or want, and ſlackneſs to think, deviſe, remember, and effect what is praiſe-worthy; or outward, breaking forth in life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, both in word, and actions.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it liveth in us, but lieth dead, and ſtirreth not with violence; and ſometimes it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth boiſterouſly, and carrieth us headlong to that which is forbidden.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it ruſheth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and directly againſt God, and ſometimes it reacheth more
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170506:129"/>properly to the hurt of our neighbour. Oh my ſoul, look into thy ſelf, and thou ſhalt finde the branches of this venemous tree to exceed in number: Thou haſt ſinned againſt God, thy neighbour, and thy ſelf; thou haſt ſinned of ignorance, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, negligence; and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Thou haſt been led away with the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eye, and pride of life: Sin ever moveth, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtirreth violently, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruleth many times to the committing of what is evil, and hinderance of what is good. Thou haſt offended in that which is evil in it ſelf, and thou haſt come ſhort in that which is good and honeſt, not doing it at all, or failing in the manner, meaſure, and circumſtances: Who can tell how often hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth?
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170506:130"/>The number of my ſins cannot bee reckoned, nor the filthineſs diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Piety is amiable, lovely, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, ſin loathſome and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable. The fear of the Lord makes the face to ſhine; but impiety and ſin diſ-figure the face and Image of God in him. The man that feareth the Lord ſhall bee praiſed; but a vile, naughty perſon, is had in contempt of God, and good men, how great ſoever hee bee in this world: The righteous is more excellent than his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Grace exalteth the poor; ſin debaſeth the mighty. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs makes a man as like to God, as a creature can bee like to the Creator, but ſin tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth us into the likeneſs of the Devil. No man is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but the virtuous, none
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170506:130"/>baſe, but the ſinner.</p>
            <p>Sin is oppoſite to God in a ſort, not by an inward poſitive repugnance, or contrariety to his nature, ſuch as is twixt fire and water; but in reſpect of outward diſagreement, ſuch as may bee in a creature from the Creator: Even as the good created, though it hath not an inward agreement with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the Creator, ſuch as is betwixt nouriſhment, and the thing nouriſhed, for then ſhould the divine nature inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it ſelf bee better for it, and neceſſarily will it; yet hath it an outward agreement and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. So is it moſt true of ſin, that it hath no inward diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Divine Nature, for then it ſhould bee the worſe for the being of it, and ſo ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily nill it; but outward only.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:170506:131"/>
            <p>The venome and filthineſs of ſin is ſet forth by ſundry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons in the holy Scriptures: Sinners are compared to Doggs, Swine, Vipers, Aſps, Bears, Tygers; Sin is known by the name of Rebellion, Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Filthineſs, Adultery, Playing the Harlot. It is likened to menſtruous clouts, &amp; filthy raggs, that are caſt aſide upon the dunghil, and deteſted of all that paſs by. It is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nakedneſs, a ſpiritual leproſie, a ſpiritual crookedneſs, a ſpiritual drunkenneſs. It biteth as a Serpent, and ſtingeth as a Cockatrice; creepeth as a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, or deadly canker, that eateth to the heart, and cannot bee cured. It is hony in the mouth, but gravel in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, ſweet in the beginning, but death in the latter end. Oh my
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170506:131"/>ſoul, if thou peruſe the holy Scriptures, thou ſhalt finde no book, no leaf, no chapter, nor ſcarce any verſe wherein there is not ſome precept, promiſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, threatning, or example, which ſerveth to ſhew the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miableneſs of virtue, and ugli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of vice, and with what care, zeal, watchfulneſs, the one is to bee imbraced, and the other to bee ſhunned.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are theſe things to bee preſſed upon the heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt work the heart to humiliation for ſin; ſtir up our ſelves earneſtly to ſeek pardon, and labour for grace to have ſin in deteſtation for the time to come. Is it even ſo, Oh my ſoul, is ſin ſo loathſome and abominable, odious to God, contrary to godlineſs, perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to thy ſtate, life and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170506:132"/>welfare, more infectious than the plague, more ſtinking than any carrion, the rottenneſs and corruption of the ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and cryed down in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very book, in every leaf, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every verſe of the holy Bible? Woe therefore, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las to mee that have ſo long layen under this burden and bondage, and that even many times willingly and wittingly. When I look into my ſelf, I can ſee nothing but a maſs of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption preſſing mee down. Mine underſtanding covered with ignorance, vanity, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I know nothing as I ought to know; ſuch deadneſs poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth my heart, that I cannot look up: my ſoul is a very den, and cage of unclean motions, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires, corrupt projects, vain boaſtings, idle rovings; but
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170506:132"/>marvelous barren, untoward, toward that which is good: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, diſtruſt, pride, ſelf-confidence, blockiſhneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs, envy, malice, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, covetouſneſs, do lodge with mee continually. I was born in ſin, and it hath grown up with mee from my youth; ſo that it is become exceeding ſtrong, an old ſtinking, deep fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered ſore, that can hardly bee cured. My ſins are multiplied exceedingly, increaſe daily, in number they paſs the ſands by the Sea, and are become a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den too heavy for mee to bear. When I remember theſe things, I wonder at my ſelf that I ſhould bee thus ſenſeleſs in the midſt of all miſery. Were I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of one that had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted for treaſon, and ſo were pointed at as a traiterous brood
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170506:133"/>without inheritance in earth; Had I but with my nature, the ſtone, or leproſie, or falling-ſickneſs from my Parents, I ſhould bewail mine unhappy nativity: But my condition is much more wretched; for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the loins of <hi>Adam</hi> by natural propagation, with my nature I received the poiſon of ſin, which hath corrupted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power of ſoul, and like a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning leproſie, ſtaineth all it toucheth: I am unclean by birth, and whatſoever I touch, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. Were I with <hi>Job</hi> from top to toe covered with biles, it would grieve mee, but my whole ſpirit is fraught with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, more filthy than that which breaketh forth at the eye, car, &amp;c. I am aſhamed of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral nakedneſs, deeply affected with lameneſs, or deformity; if
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170506:133"/>overtaken with any loathſome diſeaſe, I grow weary of the world, and wiſh to bee ſeparated from the ſociety of men: But the nakedneſs, deformity, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ſoul and life is more ſhameful, and loathſome, filthy, and abominable. Deep is the ſtain that ſin hath made, and great is the danger that I am in by reaſon of my tranſgreſſions. If I had offended the Law, and ſtood as guilty to bee cenſured before the Tribunal of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judge, with loſs of liberty, limbs, or life, I ſhould bewail my eſtate, and condemn my folly; but I have broken the Law of God, and ſtand guilty before him, not of temporal, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, which the Law hath pronounced, and I may expect every moment to bee executed upon mee: Wherefore I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170506:134"/>my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes: Oh that mine eyes were a river of tears, and mine head a fountain of water, that day and night I could bewail the miſery into which I am plunged by reaſon of my ſin! But woe is mee, what ſhall I do? whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I fly for ſuccour? I am bound with the cords of ſin, who ſhall unlooſe them? I am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before the Throne of Juſtice, who ſhall acquit mee? I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, who ſhall make mee clean? Humble thy ſelf, oh my ſoul, and fly unto the Throne of grace, for with God there is mercy, and with him there is plentious redemption; againſt him thou haſt ſinned, and with him there is forgiveneſs; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thine iniquity, that thou mayeſt bee received unto mercy; judge thy ſelf, that thou
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170506:134"/>mayeſt not bee judged. How well is hee that ſleepeth with his <hi>quietus eſt</hi> in his boſome? In this regard Gods children have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed God more for this, than for deliverance from evils that have been upon them: <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquity is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Oh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man, who is ſtirred up to fly the wrath to come. Thou art in danger to bee caſt into the priſon of Hell for thy debts, thy ſins; which make thee debter of puniſhment to Gods juſtice. Humble thy ſelf, compound with thy creditor before his heavy arreſt bee ſerved upon thee. Shouldeſt thou have to deal with many men, thou mighteſt have a cold ſute, but ſeek mercy of God, none that cometh to him doth hee caſt forth. And now my ſoul bee
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170506:135"/>warned for the time to come, to take heed of ſin, turn from it with hatred and deteſtation, bee purged from it (as a thing fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and abominable) It is the moſt deadly poiſon, a fretting leproſie, a corruption, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of all others, moſt dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable. Wee would not ſuffer ſpots on our face, nor lint or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoil upon our cloaths; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee cannot make clean any thing, but thou mayeſt thence take the riſe of this thought, how careful ſhould I bee to cleanſe my heart? wee would not have any natural infirmities, which are unſeemly or filthy, as wry mouths, foul breeches, lameneſs, or halting in our gate, &amp;c. But a tongue ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things, rotten ſpeeches, crooked walking from Gods Law, and the direction thereof,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170506:135"/>are far more uncomely than the other. If wee go by a foul ſtinking place, wee ſtop our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and haſte away; if an ugly ſhape preſent it ſelf, wee ſhut our eyes, and indure not the view of it: Thus ſhouldeſt thou, Oh my ſoul, with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turn from all filthy and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable vices. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and too much that thou haſt diſhonoured God in time paſt, and gone a whoring after ſtrange lovers, return now unto the Lord, and keep thy ſelf chaſte unto him for ever. To ſee a childe war with his loving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or a wife contend with her kinde husband, is a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable ſight, for any ſubject to rebel againſt his Prince, is wretched lewdneſs, but for one to rebel againſt ſuch a Prince, which out of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170506:136"/>hath moſt highly advanced him, and done him favours from day to day, this is moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſloyalty. Thus it is with ſin, which offendeth a moſt kinde and merciful Father, who hath redeemed us from death, and daily ladeth us with his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: Oh that I could once finde out power and ability to weed out corruption, and to pluck it up even by the root; Oh that I were able to deſtroy the root and bud, and branch of this curſed tree, that it might never ſpring, or bear fruit any more: But alas, I ſenſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that there is in mee no ſtrength, no more than there is in a ſick man to recover himſelf, or rather in a man ſtark dead to reſtore himſelf to life: If I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to amend this or that which I finde to bee amiſs, I fail pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170506:136"/>and come ſhort of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of my deſire: Oh who is it then that is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver mee from the body of this death? ſurely none but the Lord who hath made and faſhioned mee, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to kill, and quicken, heal and wound; to thee therefore oh Lord do I make my moan, to thee I render my humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pour out my ſoul which hath ſinned againſt thee: Oh Lord, I beſeech thee for thy infinite mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, to take pity upon mee, and to heal my ſoul which hath ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee; Waſh mee thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from mine iniquity, and cleanſe mee from my ſin; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert mee oh Lord, and I ſhall be converted, ſet mee at liberty, and I ſhall run the race of thy Commandements. Open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170506:137"/>mee the fountain of grace for the waſhing away of my ſin and uncleanneſs. It is thy proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have mercy, it is thy free covenant to write thy Law upon my heart. Thou haſt promiſed to pour rivers of waters upon the dry and thirſty ground. Thou inviteſt the barren ſoul to come unto thee for eaſe and reſt, O Lord have mercy upon mee, for in thee do I truſt, thou art the well-ſpring of grace and mercy, the fountain of life, the author and preſerver of grace, unto thee do I commend my ſoul, and upon thy merciful promiſe I will wait as long as I live.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Let the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption bee the eighth Inſtance, how are wee to proceed in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on that work?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this work wee muſt conſider the Author, Subject,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170506:137"/>Object, Cauſes, Ends, Parts and Properties, what is like, and what unlike.</p>
            <p>To redeem is to deliver from bondage and miſery, freely, or upon exchange; and to free from captivity by ſtrong hand, or ranſome; which two latter have place in the Redemption of man, in divers reſpects.</p>
            <p>The Author of this great, admirable, and extraordinary work of Grace, is Jeſus Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, who in time became man, and was made under the Law, that hee might redeem us that were under the Law: For this hee is called our Saviour, and Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or Redemption of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who doth deliver them from the hand of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that they might ſerve the Lord without fear. Thoſe that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170506:138"/>God did raiſe up to redeem his people, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Judges, yea thoſe that redeemed as kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men this or that, were ſhadows of this our great Redeemer, who was in time to bee revealed. Chriſt hath ſatisfied revenging-juſtice, overcome Satan, killed ſin, and purchaſed deliverance for his people that are given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of his Father, and ſuch as beleeve in him are partakers of this Redemption in truth in this life, perfectly in the life to come: For from what time wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Jeſus Chriſt, by a ſoveraign, well-rooted, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſoning Faith, wee are freed from being under the Law, and revenging-juſtice of God. The ſtrong man is caſt forth from what time Chriſt the ſtronger is entred. The conſcience is made a ſweet companion and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170506:138"/>rather than a rigorous kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Where the King hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed a Priſoner, the Jaylor can have no further power over him, for hee is but to keep him during the Kings pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Again, By grace God doth ſet our wills at liberty, ſo that ſin cannot reign in us as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yea the world is crucified to us, and wee unto the world: For as when health cometh, a man beginneth to walk abroad, and do ſuch things as hee could not ſtir to do while his ſickneſs did keep him under: ſo it is here.</p>
            <p>Finally wee are ſo freed, that we can ſuffer nothing which our wills have cauſe to be unwilling with, all things being ſuch as ſhal work together for our good.</p>
            <p>Behold the rich grace, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable love, and tender mercy of the Lord towards man in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170506:139"/>moſt miſerable, rebellious, and worthy to bee caſt off for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that hee gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever beleeveth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Oh Lord, as our ſin and miſery abounded, thy mercy hath ſuperabounded. In mercy thou didſt provide a means for mans deliverance, that juſtice being ſatisfied, grace might bee glorious in his ſalvation: Oh God, when thou hadſt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that juſtice ſhould take her revenge, if by breach of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhee bee wronged, thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdome found out a way to ſatisfie wronged juſtice; when all mankinde lay under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unable to help themſelves, thine unſpeakable mercy did ſhew her ſelf for our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170506:139"/>when man had nothing to pay for his Ranſome, nor any ſtrength to reſcue himſelf from the hands of juſtice, or the curſe of the Law, of thine endleſs love thou didſt give Chriſt to bee our Saviour, and by way of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to redeem us: Oh my ſoul, thou art redeemed not with ſilver or gold, but with the blood of Chriſt, a lamb un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled. This was it which in the blood of all the ſacrifices was prefigured: The death of Chriſt is it by means whereof Gods Grace doth ſet thee free, and that in moſt juſt manner. It doth pacifie juſtice her diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt ſin: For God (that is) God as his Revenging Juſtice is gone forth, is ſaid to ſmell a ſavour of reſt in the death of Chriſt, and by Chriſts being put under the Law, or curſe of Gods
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170506:140"/>revenging made manifeſt in the Law, wee are ſaid to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the Law or curſe, as by an all-ſufficient Ranſome accepted of Juſtice. This death doth feee us from the Devil, for Satans power over us was by reaſon of ſin, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to it from the Juſtice of God. By death hee deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that had the power of executing death. The price of our Ranſome was paid to divine Juſtice; and it being paid and accepted, Satan was caſt down by ſtrong hand. This death hath obtained the Spirit to bee given thee, which doth free thee from the captivity of luſts,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4, 5</note> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thee to finde liberty in actions of godlineſs. Through this death thou haſt deliverance from all evils; So that all tears in Gods Time ſhall bee wiped
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170506:140"/>from thine eyes, and in the mean while all thy ſufferings are ſo changed, that they are not effects of Gods Revenging Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to deſtroy, but ſuch things in which God doth offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Father, intending to make thee partake further by means of them in the quiet fruit of Righteouſneſs. And now my ſoul, why hath the Lord done this for thee? that the Glory of his Grace might bee magnified in thy ſalvation, and thou mighteſt ſerve him all the daies of thy life. As for the parts of Redemption, it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed or poſſeſſed, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun or conſummated in reſpect of guilt and puniſhment, or power and tyranny of ſin. <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in a day. Great things are not begun and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all at once. Redemption
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170506:141"/>takes not its full effect in this life, but it is ſo begun, that it ſhall certainly bee accompliſhed in due time.</p>
            <p>The Properties of this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance will ſet forth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of it in ſome ſort. It is true and real, as far excelling that Redemption of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as the ſubſtance doth the ſhadow, the ſoul doth the body, and Chriſt did <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is ſpiritual, from Sin, Satan, and the curſe of the Law. The bondage of ſoul to the wrath of God, tyranny of Satan, and ſlavery of ſin is moſt lamentable and grievous; and the more fearful the captivity, the more comfortable the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>Nor is this mercy vouchſafed to a few that live in ſome corner of the world, in ſome ſpecial
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170506:141"/>age, or time, which much leſſen the value of it; but it is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, extended to all ages, to all ſorts of men, high and low, rich and poor.
<note n="a" place="margin">Apoc. 5.9</note> 
               <hi>Thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people,</hi> and which is the upſhot of all, <hi>this Redemption is eternal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9.12.</note> Hee that is ranſomed out of the power of a bodily enemy, may bee taken captive the ſecond time; but hee that is ſet free by Jeſus Chriſt, cannot bee capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by Satan. It was a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour that God raiſed up Saviours to deliver them out of the hands of their oppreſſors: It is a much greater mercy that God hath given us Chriſt to ſet us free from ſpiritual thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for that Redemption was typical, this real; that temporal of the body, this ſpiritual of the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170506:142"/>ſoul, and conſcience: That from the cruelty of man, this from the tyranny of Satan; that thraldome would have ended with life, this bondage would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have increaſed daily: After that deliverance they might and did return to bondage, But in this Redemption, hee that is once freed, abideth a freeman for evermore; Thoſe Saviours were meer men, but Chriſt our Redeemer is God and Man; They delivered their people by force of arms, but Chriſt by his death firſt payed the price of our Redemption, and then God by his great power reſcued us from the hands of the Devil: They brought their Redeemed into an earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but Chriſt our Redeemer hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us an heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. They ſaved them that
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170506:142"/>were oppreſſed, and evil-intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt their wills; but Chriſt ſet us free, who had volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſold our ſelves into the ſtate of ſlavery.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are theſe things to bee applied unto the heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Upon conſideration of theſe things, wee muſt ſtir up our ſelves to ſeek the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus; fly unto him with ſound affiance, rejoyce in God, and ſing praiſes to his name: Oh my ſoul, is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſpiritual thraldome to bee found in Jeſus Chriſt, then enquire after him, and ſeek to know him with gladneſs. The Name Jeſus is ſweet, honey in the mouth, melody in the ear, a Jubile in the heart. What a ſervant were hee that knew not his Maſters Name? is not hee unworthy the benefit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170506:143"/>that will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to enquire who hath paid his Ranſome? Oh my ſoul, fly unto Chriſt in whom thou ſhalt finde deliverance from all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thraldome. God hath made Chriſt an <hi>Adam,</hi> Head, Root, Store-houſe, in whom are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured all thoſe good things, which from him are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us: Wee love to thruſt amongſt them with whom wee may finde benefit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; Seek this above all, that thou mayeſt bee by Faith in Chriſt. Should Bankrupts hear of any that ſhould anſwer their creditors for them, they would quickly reſort to him: how much more ſhouldeſt thou reſort to this Mediatour, and Surety, who will anſwer the debt of thoſe that come unto him by Faith? ſeek to bee ingrafted
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170506:143"/>into him, ſtrive by Faith to grow up in him: for the more nearly wee are united with any thing, the more wee partake of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and operation of it. Thoſe that are neareſt the fire, partake in the heat of it more than thoſe that are further removed. Thou ſeeſt men ſeek to bee made one perſon in law, to bee moſt near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyned to ſuch as may bring them in wealth: Oh my ſoul, why doſt thou not ſeek more earneſtly by a ſpiritual marriage to become one with him in whom is every good bleſſing: Behold hee ſueth unto thee, not that hee might bee enriched by thee, for thou haſt nothing to give, hee ſtands in need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that hee might anſwer thy debt, ſet thee at liberty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn thee with grace, and endow thee with eternal life. O my
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170506:144"/>ſoul, what great cauſe haſt thou to love the Lord, and rejoyce in his mercy! God hath given his Son to dye for us, before we asked it: Chriſt hath (when wee could not through our graceleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs once ask him) fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, and diſcharged us from the danger of ſin. Wee take it as love in men, if ſpoken to, they will do ſmall matters for us; Hee that will bear a blow for us in our behalf, bee bound for us in great ſumms of mony, ſpecially hee that will lye by it for our good: But how much more art thou to acknowledge this grace of Chriſt, who hath been thy Surety, paid for thy deliverance, not ſilver or gold, but his precious blood? The inſenſible creatures are called upon to rejoyce for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Gods people; when
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:170506:144"/>they were redeemed from <hi>Babel,</hi> the joy did put them into an extraſie, they knew not whether they were aſleep or awake: But this ſpiritual Redemption doth as far out-ſtrip that temporal freedome, as Heaven is above the Earth, or hell worſe than the houſe of bondage. <hi>Sing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, oh my ſoul, make a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful noiſe unto the God of thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> What cauſe haſt thou to praiſe him, who hath viſited and redeemed thee with ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? Thou mayeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the day when thou waſt in thraldome to the burning wrath of God, and ſtoodeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condemnation of the Law, when it was death to bee held to the duties of godlineſs, in which is the exerciſe of true freedome; and ſin did hold thee ſo faſt, that though thou ſaweſt
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170506:145"/>the miſchief of it, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedſt ſometimes a new courſe, yet thou couldeſt not return to it as before, when this luſt and that paſſion did tyrannize over thee, and fears of conſcience, and death did hold thee in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: But now the Lord hath looked upon thee in mercy, his wrath is appeaſed, the Law is anſwered, Satan is caſt down, and thou art received into ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour to walk with him. Oh Lord, I am aſhamed that I ſhould bee ſo ſenſeleſs at the remembrance of this unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love, ſo forgetful of this undeſerved kindneſs; move the ſcales from mine eyes, I pray thee, and take the veil from my heart, which will not let mee rejoyce in ſo excellent mercy.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Shew how wee muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in Meditation on the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="273" facs="tcp:170506:145"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Wee muſt conſider the Subject, Antecedents, Cauſes, End, Time, Place, and things that happened with it, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, properties, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, what is like, and what unlike.</p>
            <p>My ſoul deſires to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reſurrection of Chriſt, in which I may behold the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled face of God. Dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, direct my mind, rightly to conceive of this high myſtery, to the glory of thy Name, and the comfort of my ſoul: To riſe from the ſleep of ſin, is to leave or deſiſt from evil. Hee that is fallen proſtrate, ariſeth when he gathers up himſelf. Hee that layeth himſelf down to reſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth when hee is raiſed from ſleep. Hee that is dead ariſeth when the ſoul is knit to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: The Reſurrection of Chriſt
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170506:146"/>is the firſt degree of his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein the ſoul being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited again to his body, hee was raiſed up to ſpiritual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life. It is a motion part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural, partly ſupernatural; Natural in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, bound, and means. For Chriſt roſe ſo out of the grave, that hee is ſaid to bee there no more, and he roſe by means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a natural body, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed which might ſeem to hinder. Nor was this Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in a moment but in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſucceſſion of time, which is required to every natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nevertheleſs this motion is ſupernatural, in reſpect of the cauſe, efficient, and the end: The Divine Nature of Chriſt could not ſuffer, nor dye, nor riſe again; but hee was raiſed to life in reſpect of that nature that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170506:146"/>died for our ſins, or in reſpect of the body, which for a time was ſeparated from the ſoul, and laid in the grave. This was prefigured by types, foretold by the Prophets of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and moſt clearly ſpoken to his Diſciples by our Saviour himſelf, ſignifying unto them that the Son of Man muſt ſuffer at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and bee buried, and the third day riſe again.</p>
            <p>The principal cauſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, was the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, moſt ſtrictly united with the Humanity: In Scripture this work is aſcribed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 2.24.</note> who is ſaid to raiſe his Son; and to the Son,
<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1.4. Joh. 10.18</note> 
               <hi>who by his Divine power,</hi> or as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>by the eternal Spirit raiſed up himſelf. I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it:</hi> Of his infinite
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170506:147"/>love towards his Elect, hee laid down his life, and of the ſame love and affection toward them, hee roſe again, which is more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſeen in this, that hee did vouchſafe to call them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; with which ſweet name, full of love hee had not before ſaluted any man. As hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the moſt grievous torment for the ſalvation of the Elect his choſen people, ſo for the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Spouſe, that is, the Church, hee roſe again that hee might inrich and beautifie her with ſpoils, taken from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>The Cauſes lead us to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the End, why Chriſt roſe again, for every proper efficient, intendeth an end which is ever good, and that moſt excellent as the worker is of greateſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and excellency: Now
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170506:147"/>therefore, ſince Chriſt roſe in ſpecial love to his peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it muſt needs tend to their ſpecial exceeding great good: By his Reſurrection the glory of Chriſt which hee had with the Father (before the foundation of the world) was manifeſted, which the world would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge by his Sermons, nor by miracles confirming his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. By his Reſurrection he obtained thoſe glorious Titles with which the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould bee adorned: ſuch as bee;
<note place="margin">Act. 3.15. 1 Cor. 15.20. Col. 1.15, 18. Apoc. 1.5. Rom. 14.9</note> 
               <hi>The Prince of life, the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep, the firſt-born of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature, the firſt-born from the dead, and the first-begotten of the dead; and the Lord of Dead and Living.</hi> By his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hee ſhewed himſelf to bee the Conquerour of Death, Sin,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170506:148"/>and Satan; meritoriouſly hee triumphed over our enemies upon the Croſs; actually hee began his triumph at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
<note place="margin">Col. 2.23, 24.</note> Now when the powers of Hell could no longer hold him under, it is manifeſt that they are ſubdued, and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. By his Reſurrection hee declareth that his ſatisfaction is fully abſolute. Had the leaſt penny of our debt remained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore not diſcharged, hee could not have looſed the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Death. <hi>Chriſt died for our ſins, and roſe again for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi> By the Reſurrection hee prepared himſelf to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious function of a Mediatour. As hee ſuffered without the gate to pay the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: So did hee enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven to appear before the Father for us. Hee died once
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170506:148"/>for our ſins, and now liveth for ever to make interceſſion for us. By his death hee purchaſed life and ſalvation for his people, and now ſitting in glory at the right hand of the Father, hee doth communicate the bleſſing that hee hath procured for them. Chriſt roſe, that wee might riſe: <hi>For hee that raiſed up the Lord Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.14.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall raiſed up us with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and ſet us together with him.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning upon the third day after hee was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, our Saviour roſe out of the Sepulchre in which hee was laid, at which time there was a mighty Earthquake, and an Angel deſcended from Heaven to rowl away the ſtone, at which glorious apparition, the ſouldiers that kept the Tomb were ſore affraid, and became as dead men.</p>
            <pb n="280" facs="tcp:170506:149"/>
            <p>The death of Chriſt wanted not ſigns of Majeſty, nor his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection tokens of exceeding glory? when the Earth was moved at his preſence, and the Angels deſcended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to do him ſervice. The effects of this Reſurrection are far more glorious than the ſigns that did accompany it: for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his Reſurrection had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his cruel death, all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits appropriated to us had layen buried together with him.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17. Rom. 6.8, 9 1 Cor. 15.55. 1 Pet. 1.3. 1 Cor. 15.21, 22.</note> The Reſurrection of Chriſt is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table confirmation of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the abolition of ſin and death, regeneration unto life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; and vivification of our bodies are the fruits of it. It was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould riſe, in regard of the excellency of his perſon, for being the proper Son of God, it was impoſſible
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170506:149"/>hee ſhould bee held of the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of death; being juſt and innocent as man, it could not bee that hee ſhould lye under the power of the grave, and dying to overcome, hee could not bee vanquiſhed of the enemies. It was alſo neceſſary in reſpect of the Covenant hee had made with the Father, the dignity of his high office of eternal Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the truth of thoſe things which were foretold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the glory of the <hi>Meſsias</hi> might bee fulfilled: Many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable things are ſpoken touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and the glory of his Kingdome, who was firſt to lay down his life, and then to take poſſeſſion of his Kingdome in glory; where hee ſhall live for ever to make interceſſion for his people, which hee could not have done if hee had not
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170506:150"/>riſen. It cannot bee that the Word of God ſhould take none effect, but it was foretold that the <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould riſe again, in which reſpect his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was neceſſary. Chriſt not as a private perſon, but as a publick perſon. Hee died for his Elect, and virtually they roſe in him, when hee roſe from the dead, of whoſe Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection they partake actually, when by lively Faith they are made one with him.</p>
            <p>This Reſurrection was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glorious, in reſpect of the power by which it was effected, the life into which hee roſe, and the things that accompanied, or followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſurrection: For the graves did open, and many bodies of them that ſlept in the earth, aroſe. Whereby the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170506:150"/>grave did witneſſe, that its power was taken away, and clean vanquiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonah</hi>'s deliverance out of the Whales belly was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and miraculous; the Lord was gracious in ſparing <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and raiſing him as it were from death, who was a ſlain Sacrifice in his Fathers account. But theſe were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly types, and ſhadows of Chriſt, his Reſurrection the life and glory of the other.</p>
            <p>The elect and faithful ſhall riſe to glory at the day of judgement, but they ſhall riſe by the power of Chriſt. Chriſt aroſe by his own power: they ſhall riſe as the Members of Chriſt, but Chriſt roſe as the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep: they ſhall riſe as private perſons, but Chriſt aroſe as a publick:
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170506:151"/>They ſhall ariſe from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but Chriſt his body did not ſee corruption: They ſhall riſe to immortality and glory for themſelves, but Chriſt roſe to glory that hee might govern his Church in glory, and bring his Elect unto himſelf, that where hee is, there they might bee for ever.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are theſe things to bee preſſed upon the heart?</hi>
